WEBVTT

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:57.123
It wasn't me! I didn't kill her!

00:00:57.724 --> 00:00:59.659
Make sure Jang Tae San stays silent.

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:02.095
You have to risk your life to see this.

00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:28.388
"Police"

00:01:58.251 --> 00:01:59.986
- What a shame. - Be careful.

00:02:00.086 --> 00:02:01.488
What happened?

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:03.323
- Or said. - Or Lalhol.

00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:05.325
Hey.

00:02:20.073 --> 00:02:21.141
I will place a bet.

00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:25.445
I wait.

00:02:27.914 --> 00:02:30.116
- Wait. - Everyone is waiting.

00:02:37.624 --> 00:02:38.625
I back down.

00:02:39.592 --> 00:02:41.528
- I bet 10 thousand won. - I'll place the bet!

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:43.496
I will increase the bet.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.034
I'll put in an extra 100,000 won.

00:02:51.037 --> 00:02:52.138
I'll place a bet!

00:02:56.776 --> 00:02:59.279
Today is not my lucky day.

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:01.748
Let's just forget it.

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:03.416
Why do you mix these cards?

00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:07.587
- Don't bother looking. - What is this?

00:03:10.223 --> 00:03:13.526
It's not like you haven't seen that before.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.628
Okay, that's enough.

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:18.364
You won't have to sell fruits for a few days, Mr. Zhang.

00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:20.033
Look at all this money!

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:22.135
I can't believe you tried to fool me.

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.637
The means does not matter

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:27.473
As long as I win money.

00:03:27.907 --> 00:03:29.175
Take this.

00:03:31.177 --> 00:03:33.780
Come on, give me more.

00:03:33.913 --> 00:03:36.683
I lost a lot of money since yesterday, that's not enough.

00:03:41.754 --> 00:03:42.789
You!

00:03:48.628 --> 00:03:49.762
Forget it, you idiot.

00:03:54.968 --> 00:03:56.402
Gudauri, what's going on?

00:03:58.972 --> 00:03:59.973
Really?

00:04:01.374 --> 00:04:03.343
- Hello sir. - Hello sir.

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:05.178
- Hello sir. - Hello.

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:14.320
Sir, you have arrived.

00:04:14.654 --> 00:04:15.655
You...

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:18.625
There is a client who would like to see you.

00:04:18.725 --> 00:04:19.759
Customer?

00:04:23.329 --> 00:04:24.364
Come on.

00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:28.234
Do you think I'm the host? I am only responsible for management.

00:04:29.035 --> 00:04:30.136
Do I look like a host?

00:04:30.903 --> 00:04:31.904
What a shame, sir.

00:04:32.338 --> 00:04:34.507
I ordered a 30 year old whiskey and asked to see you.

00:04:34.574 --> 00:04:36.109
What was I supposed to do?

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:40.013
-Pay me. - What?

00:04:40.847 --> 00:04:42.048
Pay me.

00:04:43.683 --> 00:04:46.819
You will get money from that woman. And you want money from me too?

00:04:47.086 --> 00:04:48.755
What are you talking about?

00:04:49.055 --> 00:04:50.590
Okay, that's okay. Oh my God.

00:04:51.157 --> 00:04:52.692
I didn't make much money today.

00:04:53.693 --> 00:04:56.929
How about ordering another bottle?

00:04:57.163 --> 00:05:00.033
I will pass out after drinking half a bottle.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.901
Move.

00:05:04.737 --> 00:05:07.040
He would be stupid if he didn't get the money.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.941
Maybe I should have gone instead.

00:05:10.043 --> 00:05:11.110
I have arrived.

00:05:11.511 --> 00:05:12.679
Why were you late?

00:05:13.746 --> 00:05:15.848
Why did you come alone today?

00:05:16.215 --> 00:05:18.618
- Last time, I came with... - Stop being so pedantic.

00:05:18.718 --> 00:05:20.620
You know I came to see you.

00:05:21.621 --> 00:05:24.390
I don't live here. Why do you come here to see me?

00:05:24.957 --> 00:05:27.794
I have something to give you. But you didn't call me,

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.462
And I don't have your phone number.

00:05:31.597 --> 00:05:32.598
Here you go.

00:05:34.233 --> 00:05:35.234
What is this?

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:38.705
It's...

00:05:39.072 --> 00:05:40.573
Suit from Giovanni.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.377
How did you know my size?

00:06:06.766 --> 00:06:09.402
We caught her trying to get on a plane to Japan and brought her here.

00:06:09.635 --> 00:06:11.037
I'm sorry.

00:06:11.904 --> 00:06:13.239
I'm sorry, sir.

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:18.244
Mrs. Jeong.

00:06:18.845 --> 00:06:20.847
How long have you been working for me?

00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:24.217
10 years sir.

00:06:26.586 --> 00:06:29.088
Didn't you earn enough money during those ten years?

00:06:29.956 --> 00:06:33.025
That idiot took all my money and ran away.

00:06:34.026 --> 00:06:35.361
I needed money to live.

00:06:36.496 --> 00:06:39.499
You know I'm no longer needed in this job.

00:06:42.235 --> 00:06:45.671
Even if you were useless, I allowed you to work for me.

00:06:46.372 --> 00:06:49.709
But you dared to steal me after your motherfucker stole from you?

00:06:51.544 --> 00:06:53.613
How dare you betray me?

00:06:56.849 --> 00:06:59.152
You dared to stab me in the back.

00:06:59.786 --> 00:07:01.654
Please forgive me this time, sir.

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:04.657
I will do anything you ask.

00:07:12.298 --> 00:07:14.901
Don't do this, sir. Please have mercy on me.

00:07:15.067 --> 00:07:17.670
Don't do this please! I'm sorry!

00:07:17.737 --> 00:07:18.738
I'm sorry!

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:21.140
No!

00:07:21.474 --> 00:07:23.176
They treated her wound well.

00:07:23.743 --> 00:07:25.778
Have her wash the dishes when she recovers.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:34.954
"He rests his head on his arm"

00:07:35.054 --> 00:07:36.823
- What are you doing? - What a shame.

00:07:36.923 --> 00:07:38.491
Is she serious?

00:07:38.591 --> 00:07:43.763
“Then...he sleeps.”

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:45.264
Get out of here!

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:47.200
Hey...

00:07:51.737 --> 00:07:52.805
Have you been fired again?

00:07:52.905 --> 00:07:54.907
They asked me to sing my favorite song.

00:07:55.374 --> 00:07:57.577
So I sang it, but they expelled me because I spoiled the atmosphere, they said.

00:07:58.077 --> 00:08:00.179
I asked you to assign it to respected customers.

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:03.082
There were no girls available. I was the only one.

00:08:03.182 --> 00:08:04.217
We will be more careful, sir.

00:08:06.285 --> 00:08:07.620
What did you sing?

00:08:08.054 --> 00:08:10.957
“When the mother goes to the island...”

00:08:11.057 --> 00:08:12.058
It's...

00:08:15.528 --> 00:08:18.464
Which rooms are empty? I want to hear my beautiful girl singing.

00:08:19.098 --> 00:08:23.469
“I wonder why I didn't ask you to come with me.”

00:08:23.736 --> 00:08:26.005
Tae San, you're a great singer.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.676
I asked us to take a taxi. Why are we still walking?

00:08:31.244 --> 00:08:32.612
We have arrived.

00:08:35.281 --> 00:08:36.883
"Design Hotel"

00:08:38.951 --> 00:08:40.887
This is not my home.

00:08:40.953 --> 00:08:43.890
I don't know where you live.

00:08:43.956 --> 00:08:46.325
Come on, let's go, we've arrived.

00:08:46.425 --> 00:08:49.161
- I don't live here. - We have arrived.

00:08:54.901 --> 00:08:57.703
- Excuse me? - You said that you would like to open a bakery.

00:08:59.639 --> 00:09:02.842
I will open a bakery for you, leave your job and settle with me.

00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:05.578
Should I call her Mrs. Moon now?

00:09:05.678 --> 00:09:08.080
I want to go home.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.421
- What was that? -I'm sorry, sir.

00:09:15.655 --> 00:09:18.257
A crazy person jumped in front of my car.

00:09:18.324 --> 00:09:19.692
- Go out and check it out. - Okay, sir.

00:09:22.295 --> 00:09:24.263
I'm sorry. Sorry about that.

00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:29.001
Do you want to die?

00:09:29.302 --> 00:09:30.336
It's...

00:09:34.206 --> 00:09:36.442
Don't worry about him. He's just scum.

00:09:36.842 --> 00:09:40.046
You are Jang Tae San.

00:09:40.112 --> 00:09:41.948
Let go.

00:09:44.283 --> 00:09:47.386
You should pay attention to the road.

00:09:48.154 --> 00:09:50.890
“Tae San!” Wow.

00:09:51.057 --> 00:09:53.125
Are you okay? Get up.

00:09:56.529 --> 00:09:58.364
What a fool.

00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:00.600
“Tae San.” Oh my God.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.969
Are you okay?

00:10:49.215 --> 00:10:51.150
Let's blame the alcohol.

00:11:03.696 --> 00:11:05.965
Wow, that lady is amazing.

00:11:06.699 --> 00:11:08.067
Sir, did you sleep well?

00:11:10.569 --> 00:11:13.172
Have you finished working?

00:11:16.275 --> 00:11:17.343
You should sleep a little.

00:11:20.413 --> 00:11:22.448
Damn!

00:11:22.782 --> 00:11:25.284
Did you see him checking the money as soon as he left?

00:11:25.718 --> 00:11:27.720
He is no longer a powerful gangster.

00:11:27.787 --> 00:11:30.389
So why don't they get rid of it?

00:11:30.623 --> 00:11:32.425
He is stupid and distorts our image as gangs.

00:11:32.491 --> 00:11:34.527
This is because he went to prison twice instead of the president.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:35.928
Twice?

00:11:39.832 --> 00:11:41.567
Hello, I am at home.

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:46.172
It is a soup to recover from the effects of sugar.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.842
Man-seok, you're the best.

00:11:50.109 --> 00:11:51.744
You are dirty. Go and take a shower first.

00:11:51.911 --> 00:11:53.079
I took a shower.

00:11:54.346 --> 00:11:56.582
Give me this.

00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:01.587
Why didn't you have breakfast with the person you spent the night with?

00:12:02.321 --> 00:12:04.290
Because she is not someone I eat with.

00:12:05.257 --> 00:12:06.425
How can you?

00:12:06.859 --> 00:12:09.361
To sleep with a woman if you don't love her?

00:12:09.528 --> 00:12:12.298
That's why I don't sleep with the same woman twice.

00:12:13.666 --> 00:12:16.836
Tae San, I'm asking you because I'm dying to know.

00:12:17.503 --> 00:12:19.038
What exactly are you?

00:12:19.472 --> 00:12:20.873
Are you a gangster or a thug?

00:12:21.974 --> 00:12:24.343
They call me half a gangster.

00:12:24.944 --> 00:12:28.514
Even your followers treat you with contempt.

00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:29.949
Do you want to live your life like that?

00:12:30.883 --> 00:12:32.952
My order is already over.

00:12:33.652 --> 00:12:37.056
One term in prison makes you useless in society.

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:39.658
But I went twice.

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.661
So I live this way.

00:12:49.034 --> 00:12:51.904
Oh this! Wow!

00:12:53.506 --> 00:12:54.974
It's wrinkled now!

00:13:00.379 --> 00:13:02.014
Why do you care so much about clothes?

00:13:02.081 --> 00:13:04.049
If your order has already passed?

00:13:04.583 --> 00:13:08.087
Because you don't know when and where

00:13:08.888 --> 00:13:10.656
You may meet someone.

00:13:12.491 --> 00:13:15.427
Do you have anyone you are looking forward to meeting?

00:13:25.337 --> 00:13:28.174
Take this to the dry cleaners on your way.

00:13:30.276 --> 00:13:32.344
Don't you have a conscience?

00:13:32.444 --> 00:13:35.347
The amount I spend on dry cleaning is more than our house rent.

00:13:37.216 --> 00:13:39.051
You're really making me crazy.

00:13:39.318 --> 00:13:41.086
When will you become a respectable man?

00:13:47.126 --> 00:13:48.160
You are here again.

00:13:50.796 --> 00:13:51.697
"Pawn Shop (All Ocean)"

00:13:51.797 --> 00:13:52.832
Hello.

00:13:53.465 --> 00:13:55.734
She is here to pawn her necklace with money.

00:14:02.641 --> 00:14:04.443
You look handsome today.

00:14:04.944 --> 00:14:06.545
I didn't dress up for you.

00:14:07.947 --> 00:14:09.615
- Let me see. - Okay.

00:14:14.787 --> 00:14:16.255
Did you buy a new suit?

00:14:25.297 --> 00:14:26.432
Go.

00:14:27.199 --> 00:14:29.568
- Seok Do, where is the newspaper? - She's here.

00:14:33.072 --> 00:14:34.573
See you later.

00:14:40.279 --> 00:14:41.847
What's wrong with you?

00:14:42.348 --> 00:14:44.783
She is a regular customer who comes every 3 days

00:14:44.884 --> 00:14:47.386
With her necklace and ring just so she can see you.

00:14:47.486 --> 00:14:49.054
Screw that.

00:14:50.055 --> 00:14:51.724
- Hello sir. - Bring me the things.

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:54.293
- What items? - Hurry, you understand what I mean.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.427
Golden pig.

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:01.367
You paid 6 million won for it because you thought it was made of gold?

00:15:02.134 --> 00:15:04.536
Does every gold-colored object appear to be made of gold to you?

00:15:05.304 --> 00:15:07.806
How did you know it was fake?

00:15:09.074 --> 00:15:12.344
These scoundrels defrauded 10 stores in Seoul.

00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:15.915
True? So it's natural to be fooled by their trick, right?

00:15:16.181 --> 00:15:17.349
Listen.

00:15:17.683 --> 00:15:20.452
The weight is accurate and the thickness of the gold bar is exact.

00:15:20.719 --> 00:15:22.321
It seemed real.

00:15:22.554 --> 00:15:23.956
Are you proud of that?

00:15:24.056 --> 00:15:25.324
No, that's not what I mean.

00:15:25.791 --> 00:15:28.327
But you would have paid them the same amount if you were me.

00:15:28.627 --> 00:15:31.430
Didn't other stores pay them 9 million won for 375 grams?

00:15:31.764 --> 00:15:34.733
Thanks to me, you only lost 6 million won.

00:15:37.002 --> 00:15:38.904
What are you talking about?

00:15:39.204 --> 00:15:40.873
I didn't lose 6 million won.

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.208
You should take responsibility since you gave them the money.

00:15:43.442 --> 00:15:45.244
- Me? - What are you doing here?

00:15:45.611 --> 00:15:47.379
Other than writing receipts?

00:15:48.414 --> 00:15:49.415
You are right.

00:15:49.515 --> 00:15:52.952
I asked you to study valuation, but you only gamble and go to nightclubs.

00:15:53.052 --> 00:15:54.119
Sir.

00:15:56.488 --> 00:15:57.556
Damn!

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:00.793
Do you think I'm opening a charity?

00:16:00.859 --> 00:16:02.361
Providing sustenance to beggars?

00:16:03.128 --> 00:16:05.130
Hey, what did you just say?

00:16:05.297 --> 00:16:08.067
Last winter, you lost a lot of money because you bought a fake watch.

00:16:08.233 --> 00:16:10.736
But you were so cheeky that you took your salary.

00:16:10.836 --> 00:16:13.872
Okay, you bastard, I'll pay you back, okay?

00:16:17.109 --> 00:16:18.344
Take, that's two million won.

00:16:18.777 --> 00:16:20.379
I deduct the rest from my salary.

00:16:22.514 --> 00:16:24.583
Did you sleep with someone for money last night?

00:16:26.218 --> 00:16:27.386
You lowly one.

00:16:27.453 --> 00:16:28.587
Sir.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.055
What brought you here?

00:17:04.656 --> 00:17:05.958
I came to ask you for a favor.

00:17:07.459 --> 00:17:08.527
Famous?

00:17:09.428 --> 00:17:11.330
Are you asking me?

00:17:23.008 --> 00:17:24.276
I want you to do a blood test.

00:17:26.412 --> 00:17:27.513
Blood test?

00:17:32.918 --> 00:17:35.287
Listen, I'm sorry.

00:17:36.422 --> 00:17:39.058
But I don't understand what you're saying.

00:17:39.224 --> 00:17:40.359
I have a child.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.862
It's a daughter, and she has acute leukemia.

00:17:45.364 --> 00:17:47.833
Do you have acute leukemia?

00:17:47.933 --> 00:17:49.701
You need a bone marrow culture.

00:17:50.402 --> 00:17:51.870
But I could not find a suitable donor.

00:17:54.907 --> 00:17:55.974
I see that.

00:17:59.111 --> 00:18:01.080
I understand what you mean.

00:18:03.282 --> 00:18:05.951
Actually, I don't fully understand.

00:18:07.152 --> 00:18:10.055
Did you ask all your acquaintances?

00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:12.224
Doing blood tests?

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:19.998
I think you are married.

00:18:23.001 --> 00:18:24.236
My daughter...

00:18:30.275 --> 00:18:31.443
She is 8 years old.

00:18:34.113 --> 00:18:36.715
8 years?

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:50.262
She thinks that her father is dead.

00:18:53.465 --> 00:18:57.169
Did you just say it's a burden?

00:18:57.236 --> 00:18:59.671
I say that you and the child are a burden to me.

00:19:02.908 --> 00:19:06.078
I know this will never happen, but don't expect it

00:19:06.178 --> 00:19:07.579
To meet my daughter.

00:19:08.046 --> 00:19:10.949
You have no reason or right to meet her.

00:19:11.483 --> 00:19:12.584
You know that, right?

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.121
You...

00:19:17.589 --> 00:19:19.091
Did you give birth to the baby girl?

00:19:20.659 --> 00:19:22.294
Just because you are her biological father

00:19:22.361 --> 00:19:24.196
Doesn't mean your bone marrow will match it.

00:19:24.296 --> 00:19:25.664
I ask you if you gave birth to her.

00:19:25.764 --> 00:19:27.432
This has nothing to do with you.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.303
I am planning to get married.

00:19:32.171 --> 00:19:34.806
Soo Jin considers him her father.

00:19:35.374 --> 00:19:38.577
All you have to do is take a blood test.

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:44.249
Are you planning to get married?

00:19:44.683 --> 00:19:47.553
Are you going to do a blood test or not?

00:19:49.721 --> 00:19:50.923
Do you?

00:19:52.424 --> 00:19:54.092
Did you raise the child alone?

00:19:57.930 --> 00:19:58.764
Come in.

00:20:00.999 --> 00:20:02.901
- “Tae San.” - What are you doing?

00:20:03.235 --> 00:20:04.736
Hurry and enter it.

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.676
“Tae San.”

00:20:10.742 --> 00:20:12.411
- Come in! - “Tae San.”

00:20:12.778 --> 00:20:14.346
“Tae San.”

00:20:25.457 --> 00:20:26.625
Why did you give birth to the baby?

00:20:32.631 --> 00:20:33.765
Why?

00:20:33.865 --> 00:20:35.400
I didn't ask you to give birth to her.

00:20:35.867 --> 00:20:37.002
Who asked you to do that?

00:20:37.636 --> 00:20:39.738
Why? Why did you do that?

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.709
I told you that I don't expect you to be her father.

00:20:44.676 --> 00:20:47.846
I didn't look for you even on her deathbed,

00:20:48.513 --> 00:20:51.550
Because I didn't want her to know that you were still alive.

00:21:22.347 --> 00:21:23.348
“Soo Jin.”

00:21:23.582 --> 00:21:25.884
Soo Jin, you're not supposed to run.

00:21:25.951 --> 00:21:28.086
“Soo Jin.”

00:21:29.288 --> 00:21:30.389
I will pay.

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:33.191
- She's mine now. -Give me this.

00:21:33.292 --> 00:21:34.259
- Hey! - Hey!

00:21:34.326 --> 00:21:36.495
- What a shame, sir. - Give it back.

00:21:37.095 --> 00:21:38.697
“What the hell, sir?”

00:21:39.931 --> 00:21:41.733
Soo Jin, you're so mean.

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.569
You promised me that you would play ball with me after you left.

00:21:44.703 --> 00:21:47.706
The Lord told me that I am allowed to do whatever I want here.

00:21:47.973 --> 00:21:50.242
- What? - I heard that people are allowed

00:21:50.342 --> 00:21:52.544
Do what they want before they die.

00:21:53.278 --> 00:21:54.346
What?

00:21:55.414 --> 00:21:56.448
Who told you that?

00:21:56.615 --> 00:21:59.318
Myung-jin died this morning.

00:22:00.419 --> 00:22:02.454
Her mother said this.

00:22:03.655 --> 00:22:05.891
“If I had known she would die like this

00:22:06.158 --> 00:22:08.160
I would let her play games and baseball.

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:11.263
"I would let her eat whatever she wanted."

00:22:11.763 --> 00:22:13.432
Soo Jin, that...

00:22:13.665 --> 00:22:17.336
I will also die because I will not be able to find a bone marrow donor.

00:22:17.903 --> 00:22:19.171
Therefore

00:22:19.471 --> 00:22:22.140
I am allowed to play football, wrestling, and single-leg racing.

00:22:22.474 --> 00:22:25.877
I am also allowed to eat ice cream and candy.

00:22:29.948 --> 00:22:33.051
I know for sure that you will not die.

00:22:33.151 --> 00:22:35.387
How do you know that?

00:22:35.487 --> 00:22:37.389
Do you think that God has a conscience or not?

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:39.725
Yes.

00:22:39.791 --> 00:22:41.126
Yes, that's true.

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:44.696
Therefore, it is impossible for him to take someone like you from the world.

00:22:45.197 --> 00:22:46.431
Someone like me?

00:22:46.798 --> 00:22:48.734
Which person am I?

00:22:50.635 --> 00:22:53.338
You are more cheerful than a bouncy ball

00:22:53.638 --> 00:22:56.341
And more beautiful than a flower. So if he takes you

00:22:56.608 --> 00:22:59.444
Chaos will descend upon the sky.

00:22:59.778 --> 00:23:01.847
So he will never take you. impossible.

00:23:09.054 --> 00:23:11.256
Seung Yoo, what are you doing here at this hour?

00:23:12.057 --> 00:23:15.160
- What? - Don't tell my mom, okay?

00:23:18.597 --> 00:23:22.067
What about you, “In She”? What brings you here at this hour?

00:23:22.901 --> 00:23:24.136
Well...

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:26.738
“Soo Jin.”

00:23:26.972 --> 00:23:29.641
Why don't you listen to me? You cannot play with soft toys.

00:23:29.708 --> 00:23:32.544
Mom, I'll throw Ting Ting myself.

00:23:32.611 --> 00:23:34.246
You always say that.

00:23:34.346 --> 00:23:36.615
I couldn't say goodbye to him properly.

00:23:39.718 --> 00:23:41.386
Will you be happy?

00:23:41.453 --> 00:23:44.256
If I left you without saying goodbye?

00:23:45.891 --> 00:23:47.125
What?

00:23:56.802 --> 00:23:58.970
There you are, In She.

00:23:59.204 --> 00:24:00.972
Drink this to refresh yourself.

00:24:15.053 --> 00:24:16.221
By the way,

00:24:17.222 --> 00:24:18.890
I know you feel frustrated,

00:24:19.891 --> 00:24:22.127
But you shouldn't show that to Soo Jin.

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:26.298
Is this clear?

00:24:27.098 --> 00:24:30.469
You seem very stressed and anxious these days.

00:24:31.069 --> 00:24:34.072
If you keep doing this, the feeling will spread to Soo Jin.

00:24:36.942 --> 00:24:38.243
I didn't know.

00:24:41.279 --> 00:24:42.347
Well...

00:24:42.948 --> 00:24:45.016
Soo Jin is the one who suffers the most.

00:24:45.116 --> 00:24:46.651
And what makes it resilient

00:24:47.486 --> 00:24:48.920
It is hope.

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:53.625
I wonder why I have a feeling

00:24:54.292 --> 00:24:56.862
That a donor will appear soon.

00:24:58.530 --> 00:24:59.631
I'm serious.

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:02.901
Don't worry.

00:25:19.384 --> 00:25:21.086
This has nothing to do with you.

00:25:24.155 --> 00:25:25.390
I have a child.

00:25:26.124 --> 00:25:28.827
It's a daughter, and she has acute leukemia.

00:25:29.861 --> 00:25:31.963
I told you that I don't expect you to be her father.

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:35.667
I didn't look for you even on her deathbed,

00:25:36.301 --> 00:25:39.237
Because I didn't want her to know that you were still alive.

00:26:08.366 --> 00:26:10.368
- Hello, are you okay? - Yes, hello.

00:26:11.903 --> 00:26:14.506
-Are you okay? - Hello.

00:26:22.547 --> 00:26:24.516
- Hello. - Hello.

00:26:24.583 --> 00:26:25.584
Come here.

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:28.486
No, it's okay. The representative should not interrupt the class.

00:26:29.921 --> 00:26:31.323
Yes, you are right.

00:26:31.423 --> 00:26:32.657
See?

00:26:33.525 --> 00:26:36.528
You were the one who gave me rice cakes last time.

00:26:36.828 --> 00:26:38.597
By God, do you remember that?

00:26:39.264 --> 00:26:42.233
How can I forget her taste and your generosity?

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:44.970
I heard you don't use credit cards.

00:26:45.036 --> 00:26:47.539
Is it true that you only carry 3,000 won in cash?

00:26:47.639 --> 00:26:49.641
Just because I don't use a credit card doesn't mean I don't spend money.

00:26:49.741 --> 00:26:51.443
I use a direct debit card.

00:26:52.243 --> 00:26:54.779
- I will leave now. - Goodbye.

00:26:57.082 --> 00:26:58.350
What did you say?

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:00.385
Don't you watch the news?

00:27:00.485 --> 00:27:03.989
A few months ago, they caught a thief in the Morenai market.

00:27:04.089 --> 00:27:06.157
- A thief? He had with him Representative Cho's bag.

00:27:06.958 --> 00:27:10.261
But in her wallet, he found nothing but a debit card

00:27:10.328 --> 00:27:12.263
And 3 thousand won.

00:27:12.364 --> 00:27:15.533
I heard that she is planning to send her son to the United States because he is disabled.

00:27:15.634 --> 00:27:17.802
She must economize her life because she must take care of him.

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:20.171
- No, that's not the reason. -What do you mean?

00:27:20.338 --> 00:27:24.075
I heard that she worked hard to provide food for those in need

00:27:24.175 --> 00:27:26.378
Such as people with disabilities and single mothers.

00:27:26.745 --> 00:27:28.346
Mayor of Seoul?

00:27:29.047 --> 00:27:32.250
I am not qualified for this position.

00:27:33.485 --> 00:27:35.620
The people of this country and our party will decide

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.489
Whether you are eligible or not.

00:27:37.656 --> 00:27:41.126
Internet users made a fan site for you,

00:27:41.192 --> 00:27:44.262
They support you to be the mayor of Seoul.

00:27:44.529 --> 00:27:47.966
You are the only one in our party capable of winning the elections

00:27:48.733 --> 00:27:50.168
Against Representative Jeong.

00:27:50.301 --> 00:27:53.705
I'm not interested in politics.

00:27:54.039 --> 00:27:57.108
But I heard that you are establishing a social care center in Incheon.

00:27:57.208 --> 00:27:58.209
And "Sol" too.

00:27:58.443 --> 00:28:01.880
I plan to retire from politics as soon as I finish

00:28:02.113 --> 00:28:04.015
From the fundraising event

00:28:05.016 --> 00:28:07.585
To finance the establishment of a social care center.

00:28:10.288 --> 00:28:13.158
After I finish this project, I plan to return to my son

00:28:13.758 --> 00:28:16.828
I focus on my duty as a mother.

00:28:17.429 --> 00:28:20.498
I have an appointment for a donation party.

00:28:21.032 --> 00:28:23.068
Please excuse me.

00:28:34.345 --> 00:28:36.047
This is the guest list.

00:28:43.088 --> 00:28:44.789
It is finally complete.

00:28:44.889 --> 00:28:46.391
"Donation Ceremony for the Establishment of the Incheon Social Center"

00:28:47.358 --> 00:28:50.295
What happened to the embezzlement case of the head of Eugene Gas?

00:28:50.361 --> 00:28:53.331
Articles related to the prosecution’s coverage of the crime of embezzlement

00:28:53.431 --> 00:28:55.166
It will be published tomorrow.

00:28:56.334 --> 00:28:58.169
Keep the press focused on this topic.

00:28:58.236 --> 00:28:59.838
He must be proven guilty no matter what happens.

00:29:00.138 --> 00:29:01.139
Don't worry sir.

00:29:01.206 --> 00:29:03.241
Sir, you must go now.

00:29:07.178 --> 00:29:10.248
Cut off funding for Shinga so they can't do anything

00:29:10.348 --> 00:29:12.650
- When offering shares to the public. - Yes, sir.

00:29:12.817 --> 00:29:14.252
Those fools.

00:29:14.786 --> 00:29:18.056
How dare they interfere with what I'm trying to build?

00:29:18.556 --> 00:29:20.859
“Songsil Capital”

00:30:14.846 --> 00:30:16.948
You should have come alone on a day like this.

00:30:17.248 --> 00:30:18.683
He can't hear you.

00:30:20.051 --> 00:30:23.788
Even if he could, he wouldn't leak anything we say or do.

00:30:24.222 --> 00:30:25.290
President Moon.

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:27.192
He is my son.

00:30:31.296 --> 00:30:32.664
You will miss the flight.

00:30:32.831 --> 00:30:35.166
Stop talking to me.

00:30:35.266 --> 00:30:36.901
Why didn't Jae Kyung come to see me off?

00:30:37.535 --> 00:30:38.703
I'm sorry, sir.

00:30:38.803 --> 00:30:41.372
She was late because she had to search for information about the witness.

00:30:41.472 --> 00:30:45.109
We requested surveillance footage and a witness regarding the assault crime.

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:47.545
But she found traces of attempted murder.

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:50.181
Prosecutor Park, did you...

00:30:50.248 --> 00:30:52.584
Him pushing that man on the sidewalk was strange.

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:55.153
You have a 4 p.m. flight to Chicago.

00:30:55.653 --> 00:30:57.055
I shouldn't have agreed to go.

00:30:57.288 --> 00:30:59.490
You are the one who wanted to attend the seminar.

00:30:59.591 --> 00:31:03.127
Who knew the schedule would be so complicated? I was astonished to see the record.

00:31:03.194 --> 00:31:05.964
You must stop talking and continue working.

00:31:07.432 --> 00:31:08.433
Okay.

00:31:08.967 --> 00:31:10.668
I'm almost done.

00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:14.138
I'm done, Soo Young, please print this for me.

00:31:14.205 --> 00:31:16.140
- Okay. - Okay.

00:31:17.342 --> 00:31:19.544
What is this stain on your shirt?

00:31:20.411 --> 00:31:21.246
This?

00:31:21.412 --> 00:31:23.915
Min Soo spilled soy sauce on me while eating the marinated crab.

00:31:24.249 --> 00:31:25.483
I will change my clothes before leaving.

00:31:25.984 --> 00:31:27.085
Oh this one.

00:31:27.652 --> 00:31:30.555
- Did you bring your luggage? - No, she's at home.

00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:35.426
What's wrong with you guys? I'm the one who's going to Chicago.

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:37.929
Don't worry, I won't miss the flight.

00:31:38.696 --> 00:31:40.098
I will see you when I come back.

00:31:50.241 --> 00:31:52.610
It's a secure conference room. Come in.

00:31:59.284 --> 00:32:00.718
She must have just woken up.

00:32:01.152 --> 00:32:02.720
Why don't you say hello?

00:32:02.787 --> 00:32:04.822
Excuse me? Good.

00:32:05.924 --> 00:32:07.091
Hello.

00:32:09.861 --> 00:32:11.162
"Deputy Chu"

00:32:16.868 --> 00:32:18.169
I'll let you two talk.

00:32:21.306 --> 00:32:23.174
Why did you bring me to a woman's house?

00:32:24.208 --> 00:32:25.677
Don't worry and sit down.

00:32:27.111 --> 00:32:30.515
Has she ever caused you trouble?

00:32:36.821 --> 00:32:38.156
I'll go out.

00:32:38.389 --> 00:32:39.891
Okay, I will call you.

00:33:04.849 --> 00:33:06.584
It has finally happened.

00:33:06.951 --> 00:33:10.221
Representative Cho and President Moon came to my house today.

00:33:10.755 --> 00:33:12.890
I placed the camera exactly as you told me.

00:33:12.957 --> 00:33:14.759
I am not sure that the registration has been completed.

00:33:15.026 --> 00:33:16.861
Contact me as soon as you receive the message.

00:33:18.096 --> 00:33:19.597
There is a kilogram here.

00:33:20.932 --> 00:33:23.468
Another kilogram here.

00:33:23.668 --> 00:33:24.902
Total weight 2 kilograms.

00:33:25.036 --> 00:33:26.304
What will it look like?

00:33:29.374 --> 00:33:30.575
What do you think?

00:33:31.442 --> 00:33:34.178
Don't they look like really antiques?

00:33:37.682 --> 00:33:40.985
Will you pass the radiation and trained dogs test?

00:33:42.487 --> 00:33:43.955
This is what should...

00:33:48.426 --> 00:33:50.528
We spent hundreds of millions of won last year

00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:53.464
In fabricating an incident where your bag was stolen

00:33:53.531 --> 00:33:54.932
And hold an auction for donations

00:33:54.999 --> 00:33:57.969
So we can avoid customs.

00:33:58.903 --> 00:34:00.004
What about the ship?

00:34:01.072 --> 00:34:03.674
The ship left the port of Thailand yesterday after loading these items.

00:34:05.009 --> 00:34:06.444
If you don't want to waste the last year

00:34:07.011 --> 00:34:09.213
And the hundreds of millions you spent in vain

00:34:09.947 --> 00:34:12.183
You must arrive two hours before the event starts.

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:15.053
Bring documents proving the delay of the shipment.

00:34:15.653 --> 00:34:17.588
It's the only way I can talk to the customs director.

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:20.158
You should talk to him no matter what.

00:34:20.258 --> 00:34:23.461
This project is worth 400 billion won, and you will take half of it.

00:34:27.165 --> 00:34:29.367
You don't know what might happen.

00:34:29.534 --> 00:34:32.870
I know that the fundraising event is praised by all the people.

00:34:34.505 --> 00:34:37.909
But what if the ceremony is postponed or they insist on following procedures?

00:34:38.009 --> 00:34:39.177
Customs?

00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:43.247
I heard that the head of customs loves his daughter very much.

00:34:43.915 --> 00:34:44.949
Excuse me?

00:34:45.049 --> 00:34:47.051
She is a second year student at Seonmi Arts High School.

00:34:47.385 --> 00:34:49.320
Ask someone to monitor it the day before arriving.

00:34:54.859 --> 00:34:57.695
Cho Seo Hee, Director of Strategy and Planning of the Changju Party

00:34:57.795 --> 00:35:00.965
In 2006, she sent her son to America. In 2008, she was re-elected to the Council.

00:35:02.733 --> 00:35:04.001
(Moon Il Seok)

00:35:04.068 --> 00:35:05.503
He bought land in Daegang District.

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:08.139
Il Seok's funds are listed on the Korean Stock Exchange through Songsil Capital.

00:35:08.206 --> 00:35:10.208
Get rid of the green belt

00:35:23.321 --> 00:35:25.089
"Mon-El will definitely attend the party."

00:35:30.795 --> 00:35:32.930
It is an educational center for people with disabilities in Chicago.

00:35:33.531 --> 00:35:34.799
There is a man called Daniel Kim.

00:35:35.166 --> 00:35:37.502
He's the same age and shape as Kim Seung Joon.

00:35:37.735 --> 00:35:39.570
The man you are looking for.

00:35:50.014 --> 00:35:52.450
This machine works exactly like a digital camera.

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:54.919
So you can use it as one.

00:35:55.386 --> 00:35:57.455
However, regarding video shooting,

00:35:57.555 --> 00:35:59.624
The file will disappear the moment it is recorded.

00:36:01.459 --> 00:36:04.428
"Play video"

00:36:04.495 --> 00:36:05.863
"No files"

00:36:07.431 --> 00:36:08.866
It doesn't actually save files.

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:13.738
This is wonderful.

00:36:18.276 --> 00:36:21.078
If you are going to have a blood test, come to this place

00:36:21.913 --> 00:36:23.181
At 4 tomorrow.

00:36:37.795 --> 00:36:39.764
Fresh vegetables today.

00:36:39.964 --> 00:36:41.098
Yes, you are right.

00:36:44.802 --> 00:36:45.970
Mrs. Siu.

00:36:46.304 --> 00:36:48.039
You should be at the hospital by 4.

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:50.308
You must go.

00:37:30.948 --> 00:37:33.217
"Yule University Medical Center"

00:37:38.055 --> 00:37:39.390
"Incoming call"

00:37:40.958 --> 00:37:41.959
Hello?

00:37:43.027 --> 00:37:44.095
Are you on the way?

00:37:45.529 --> 00:37:46.664
Who are you?

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:50.735
Are you "If She"?

00:37:52.169 --> 00:37:53.337
Are you coming or not?

00:37:57.074 --> 00:37:58.209
Won't you come?

00:37:59.677 --> 00:38:02.346
No, I'm about to go.

00:38:33.277 --> 00:38:34.412
You can go now.

00:38:35.946 --> 00:38:37.682
Is that all?

00:38:37.782 --> 00:38:41.152
We should test your blood to see if you are a match.

00:38:43.287 --> 00:38:45.556
If you match

00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:47.692
How will the cultivation process take place?

00:38:48.259 --> 00:38:50.328
Well, it's not a simple process.

00:38:50.695 --> 00:38:53.864
The probability of a parent matching is much lower

00:38:53.964 --> 00:38:57.068
Possibility of sibling matching.

00:38:57.401 --> 00:38:58.636
Even if you are her biological father?

00:38:59.403 --> 00:39:00.404
Yes.

00:39:00.504 --> 00:39:02.840
We check to hold on to hope because if there are no donors.

00:39:03.307 --> 00:39:05.609
In Hee cannot donate because she has hepatitis.

00:39:07.411 --> 00:39:08.412
Well...

00:39:08.512 --> 00:39:11.549
How bad is her condition?

00:39:11.615 --> 00:39:12.883
That's enough. You must go.

00:39:20.391 --> 00:39:21.425
Okay.

00:39:22.593 --> 00:39:27.098
"Blood samples"

00:39:29.967 --> 00:39:31.068
Goodbye.

00:39:31.569 --> 00:39:32.803
When will you appear?

00:39:35.573 --> 00:39:36.640
I'm talking about results.

00:39:38.743 --> 00:39:42.179
I will contact you if you match.

00:39:42.947 --> 00:39:45.383
If I don't call you are not a match.

00:39:52.223 --> 00:39:53.724
I don't believe you, In She.

00:40:00.865 --> 00:40:03.401
Stop treating me coldly.

00:40:03.901 --> 00:40:06.070
Are you that afraid? Do I scare you that much?

00:40:08.873 --> 00:40:11.575
Are you worried that I will try to take it away from you?

00:40:12.109 --> 00:40:14.578
I won't do that. never.

00:40:16.514 --> 00:40:17.782
Of course, you won't.

00:40:18.582 --> 00:40:19.917
This is as it should be.

00:40:28.359 --> 00:40:29.427
How can a person

00:40:30.494 --> 00:40:31.862
To change to this extent?

00:40:53.984 --> 00:40:57.488
"Children's ward"

00:41:23.113 --> 00:41:25.716
Don't expect to meet my daughter.

00:41:26.116 --> 00:41:29.153
You have no reason or right to see her.

00:41:29.653 --> 00:41:30.754
You know that, right?

00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:35.693
Yes, she's right.

00:41:45.736 --> 00:41:47.671
Can you pass the ball to me?

00:42:31.415 --> 00:42:33.717
Here's your ball.

00:42:43.594 --> 00:42:44.795
My father?

00:43:46.724 --> 00:43:47.858
My father.

00:43:51.095 --> 00:43:53.430
What did you just say?

00:43:55.132 --> 00:43:56.800
You are a cute girl.

00:43:57.134 --> 00:43:59.403
Why do you think I am your father?

00:44:03.407 --> 00:44:05.609
So why did you come here?

00:44:06.777 --> 00:44:07.878
Me?

00:44:09.446 --> 00:44:10.547
I...

00:44:11.782 --> 00:44:13.083
I was just passing by.

00:44:13.417 --> 00:44:15.085
I'm just a guy passing by.

00:44:18.222 --> 00:44:20.057
What a cute girl you are.

00:44:21.692 --> 00:44:23.527
Listen, Mr. Aber.

00:44:26.263 --> 00:44:28.165
Can I ask you a favor?

00:44:35.139 --> 00:44:36.173
Famous?

00:44:43.514 --> 00:44:45.049
You think "Seung Yoo"

00:44:47.151 --> 00:44:48.619
That her father is dead.

00:44:50.621 --> 00:44:51.889
I understand that.

00:44:52.623 --> 00:44:54.425
It would do me no good to know.

00:44:58.328 --> 00:45:01.265
I was desperate and went to him hoping he would be a matching donor.

00:45:03.067 --> 00:45:04.368
I know.

00:45:04.968 --> 00:45:07.971
Let's pray that everything works out and becomes compatible.

00:45:11.408 --> 00:45:13.777
But I must say that you were very harsh with him.

00:45:14.778 --> 00:45:16.680
Your wound must be deep

00:45:16.747 --> 00:45:18.949
It has not healed after 8 years.

00:45:51.782 --> 00:45:55.152
This doll is my best friend.

00:45:55.886 --> 00:45:58.422
But I can't live with her anymore.

00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:01.458
I don't have a choice

00:46:01.525 --> 00:46:04.294
Just bid her farewell.

00:46:05.629 --> 00:46:07.965
But because the doll is not a human,

00:46:08.265 --> 00:46:10.901
I can't tell her my situation.

00:46:14.838 --> 00:46:15.973
Your position?

00:46:16.039 --> 00:46:17.708
My mother told me

00:46:18.108 --> 00:46:20.611
That for every person

00:46:20.711 --> 00:46:22.212
An unjustified position.

00:46:25.916 --> 00:46:29.620
However, I can't throw it away.

00:46:36.026 --> 00:46:39.296
Are you trying to give it to me?

00:46:40.464 --> 00:46:42.132
I ask you to save it for me.

00:46:44.701 --> 00:46:47.738
This means I will return it to you.

00:46:48.338 --> 00:46:49.706
Of course.

00:46:51.575 --> 00:46:53.443
- When? - “Soo Jin.”

00:46:55.012 --> 00:46:56.346
“Soo Jin.”

00:47:08.292 --> 00:47:10.627
Give it back to me later, okay?

00:47:15.632 --> 00:47:16.733
Promise me.

00:47:45.028 --> 00:47:47.531
I must hold you and handcuff you.

00:47:47.631 --> 00:47:50.234
Why do you find it difficult to stay in bed?

00:47:50.734 --> 00:47:53.704
She said goodbye to Tingting.

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:57.574
Did you throw it?

00:47:58.442 --> 00:48:00.010
I asked someone to keep it.

00:48:01.211 --> 00:48:02.279
Who?

00:48:02.446 --> 00:48:03.714
This is a secret.

00:48:40.083 --> 00:48:41.285
My father.

00:48:42.419 --> 00:48:44.288
Why do you call me "dad"?

00:48:45.088 --> 00:48:46.757
I thought she thought I was dead.

00:48:49.026 --> 00:48:50.594
Do you call anyone "dad"?

00:48:51.461 --> 00:48:53.497
Because she grew up without a father?

00:49:46.717 --> 00:49:49.619
I really can't believe this.

00:49:52.389 --> 00:49:54.257
I can't believe I have a daughter.

00:49:57.260 --> 00:50:00.931
Moreover, she is sick.

00:50:22.319 --> 00:50:23.453
That troublemaker.

00:50:25.255 --> 00:50:27.157
She was very beautiful.

00:50:35.432 --> 00:50:36.533
Listen.

00:50:38.802 --> 00:50:39.903
Did you drink?

00:50:40.203 --> 00:50:43.073
Should I buy a digital camera?

00:50:43.907 --> 00:50:47.444
I agreed to go on a trip with Young Ja this weekend.

00:50:47.911 --> 00:50:51.348
We're going to the beach and Young Ja might bring a swimsuit.

00:50:54.885 --> 00:50:55.919
Calm down.

00:50:56.553 --> 00:50:59.623
Anyway, I feel that buying a digital camera would be a waste of money.

00:51:00.257 --> 00:51:04.194
But it's our first trip together, so I don't like taking pictures with my phone.

00:51:06.963 --> 00:51:08.465
- “Man Seok.” - Yes?

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:12.202
What's wrong with you today?

00:51:12.869 --> 00:51:15.072
You are lying on your expensive suit.

00:51:16.306 --> 00:51:17.541
Why?

00:51:18.942 --> 00:51:20.444
My heart hurts a lot?

00:51:20.911 --> 00:51:23.547
Your heart? Do you suffer from heart disease?

00:51:53.043 --> 00:51:54.244
It's there again.

00:52:09.659 --> 00:52:11.194
"Sent messages"

00:52:11.294 --> 00:52:13.130
"It has finally happened"

00:52:13.263 --> 00:52:14.431
"Unread"

00:52:15.499 --> 00:52:17.067
Why don't you check her email?

00:52:20.904 --> 00:52:22.005
Hello?

00:52:23.707 --> 00:52:25.575
Plaintiff Park traveled on a business trip.

00:52:26.376 --> 00:52:27.944
When will you come back?

00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:31.281
or said

00:52:33.483 --> 00:52:35.385
Can you send her a message?

00:52:35.652 --> 00:52:38.722
This is very important, so make sure she gets the message

00:52:38.788 --> 00:52:40.056
When I was able to contact her.

00:52:41.158 --> 00:52:42.492
Tell her

00:52:42.792 --> 00:52:46.429
I miss her. Yes, tell her I miss her.

00:52:47.264 --> 00:52:48.498
Don't forget to tell her that, okay?

00:53:08.718 --> 00:53:09.920
Congratulations!

00:53:10.654 --> 00:53:13.657
Your last hope came true.

00:53:15.825 --> 00:53:17.694
Soo Jin can live.

00:53:18.628 --> 00:53:19.663
What?

00:53:19.963 --> 00:53:23.133
It turns out that Tae San's bone marrow matches hers.

00:53:26.803 --> 00:53:27.871
Dr. Park.

00:53:28.805 --> 00:53:32.108
What do we call that? miracle?

00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:41.751
Yes, I'm Park Ji Suk.

00:53:41.818 --> 00:53:44.921
Hello, I'm Jang Tae San.

00:53:46.489 --> 00:53:47.757
One moment.

00:53:48.959 --> 00:53:50.193
It's Tae San.

00:53:54.431 --> 00:53:55.432
Hello?

00:53:57.734 --> 00:53:58.802
I am “if she”.

00:53:59.236 --> 00:54:02.539
Hello. Good...

00:54:03.473 --> 00:54:04.641
May...

00:54:06.676 --> 00:54:09.246
I was concerned with the result.

00:54:13.383 --> 00:54:15.085
Can you come to the hospital right now?

00:54:16.219 --> 00:54:19.055
Are the results out? Do I match?

00:54:19.789 --> 00:54:22.158
-You are identical. I'll explain... - Okay.

00:54:22.425 --> 00:54:24.327
I will come immediately.

00:54:30.133 --> 00:54:31.334
I match.

00:54:35.372 --> 00:54:36.539
Hey.

00:54:36.906 --> 00:54:38.041
The store...

00:54:38.842 --> 00:54:39.943
"Siuk Do"...

00:54:40.577 --> 00:54:41.911
Where is Seok Do?

00:54:44.581 --> 00:54:46.182
Sir, can you keep this for me?

00:54:46.249 --> 00:54:47.417
No, I'm busy.

00:54:47.484 --> 00:54:51.221
What do you mean? faster. I need money.

00:54:51.288 --> 00:54:53.723
- Stop joking. - Sir, please.

00:54:55.458 --> 00:54:57.027
Okay. Give it to me.

00:54:57.294 --> 00:54:58.361
How much do you need?

00:54:58.528 --> 00:54:59.929
I need 50 thousand won.

00:55:01.164 --> 00:55:05.168
“Receipt, 50 thousand won. Name: (Oh Mi Suk)”

00:55:08.905 --> 00:55:09.973
Here you go.

00:55:18.348 --> 00:55:20.583
- What are you doing here at this hour? -You are at home.

00:55:20.650 --> 00:55:23.053
I told you I'm going to the beach with Young Ja today.

00:55:23.653 --> 00:55:24.821
What are you doing?

00:55:24.954 --> 00:55:26.423
Don't ask. I'm in a hurry.

00:55:33.797 --> 00:55:35.498
Is it a snake?

00:55:35.865 --> 00:55:37.534
He slipped out of his clothes gracefully.

00:55:42.238 --> 00:55:43.373
It's a digital camera.

00:55:44.074 --> 00:55:45.942
Tae San, what is this camera?

00:55:46.042 --> 00:55:47.877
Did you borrow it for me?

00:55:48.111 --> 00:55:50.880
Are you saying that my marrow is a match for her?

00:55:51.081 --> 00:55:54.250
To be honest, I didn't expect anything, but Soo Jin is lucky.

00:55:54.951 --> 00:55:58.555
I'm glad you showed up at the right time. What would you do without him?

00:56:00.323 --> 00:56:02.826
Was her condition that bad?

00:56:03.693 --> 00:56:04.961
Didn't you tell him?

00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:10.200
If it weren't for you, Soo Jin would have died.

00:56:12.235 --> 00:56:14.371
Can you tell us the date of the surgery?

00:56:15.305 --> 00:56:18.308
I can undergo the operation today.

00:56:18.875 --> 00:56:20.844
Soo Jin needs some time to prepare.

00:56:21.578 --> 00:56:22.712
How much time do you need?

00:56:22.846 --> 00:56:25.181
We must examine her and prepare her.

00:56:25.749 --> 00:56:28.618
I will set the surgery date for the 26th. Is this date suitable for you?

00:56:28.885 --> 00:56:30.387
Yes, of course. The 26th.

00:56:31.254 --> 00:56:33.289
What should I do until then?

00:56:33.957 --> 00:56:36.493
Be careful not to injure yourself or get an infection.

00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:38.361
No wounds or infections.

00:56:39.462 --> 00:56:41.431
Okay, I'll make sure of that.

00:56:47.737 --> 00:56:51.307
"Pediatrics"

00:56:52.175 --> 00:56:55.445
I will call you the day before surgery.

00:56:57.113 --> 00:56:59.883
No, it's okay. Don't call me.

00:57:02.419 --> 00:57:03.453
Come on.

00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:06.556
I know I'm missing.

00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:09.192
But I will never forget the operation date.

00:57:09.826 --> 00:57:11.594
I will attend no matter what happens.

00:57:15.432 --> 00:57:16.633
So you don't have to contact me.

00:57:20.236 --> 00:57:21.905
I won't cause you worry.

00:57:25.675 --> 00:57:29.279
Please take care of yourself until your surgery.

00:57:29.946 --> 00:57:31.281
Don't worry about that.

00:57:32.615 --> 00:57:33.917
I will go now.

00:57:46.362 --> 00:57:50.200
"Yule University Hospital"

00:58:11.621 --> 00:58:12.956
Hello, I'm on my way back.

00:58:13.056 --> 00:58:14.224
Where are you now?

00:58:14.657 --> 00:58:16.793
I called several times. Why didn't you answer?

00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:17.961
Well...

00:58:18.695 --> 00:58:21.097
I'm in the hospital. I was visiting someone.

00:58:21.664 --> 00:58:22.832
I just went out.

00:58:23.166 --> 00:58:25.335
You have to go to the warehouse in Paju.

00:58:25.568 --> 00:58:26.870
To bring something.

00:58:27.203 --> 00:58:28.638
It's urgent, so take a taxi.

00:58:29.239 --> 00:58:31.307
What should I bring from Paju warehouse?

00:58:31.641 --> 00:58:33.710
It is full of personal loan guarantees.

00:58:35.078 --> 00:58:37.881
It's an hour. The owner keeps asking about it.

00:58:38.948 --> 00:58:42.085
Why would he put an important watch for him as collateral?

00:58:44.287 --> 00:58:45.455
or said

00:58:46.389 --> 00:58:47.824
"Dae Ryung"

00:58:48.291 --> 00:58:49.626
This vile one.

00:58:50.193 --> 00:58:54.163
I searched for 30 minutes and found nothing.

00:58:54.664 --> 00:58:55.765
Then come back.

00:58:56.766 --> 00:58:58.668
Are you trying to waste my time?

00:58:58.801 --> 00:59:00.303
You have finally arrived.

00:59:01.137 --> 00:59:02.171
Oh...

00:59:02.238 --> 00:59:04.974
Mi Suk asked you to come because she is sick.

00:59:05.041 --> 00:59:06.342
- “Mi Sook”? - Yes.

00:59:06.409 --> 00:59:08.177
Why should I go to her when she is sick?

00:59:08.244 --> 00:59:09.445
I heard you know her house.

00:59:09.746 --> 00:59:11.180
Oh Willie, that...

00:59:11.681 --> 00:59:14.551
I took her home when she fell and sprained her ankle.

00:59:14.617 --> 00:59:18.054
And then I fell in love with you.

00:59:18.388 --> 00:59:20.723
Will you stop being silly?

00:59:21.958 --> 00:59:23.459
Aren't you going?

00:59:24.961 --> 00:59:26.429
What is the cause of her illness?

00:59:28.331 --> 00:59:29.799
How bad must her illness be for her to request my presence?

00:59:30.199 --> 00:59:31.868
You should just go and visit it.

00:59:32.402 --> 00:59:34.571
She must be in very bad condition. She was crying like a baby.

00:59:35.071 --> 00:59:36.239
Really?

00:59:41.010 --> 00:59:42.545
Okay, that's okay.

00:59:42.879 --> 00:59:45.882
I will spend today saving people's lives.

00:59:48.484 --> 00:59:49.719
See you later.

01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:08.504
“Mi Sook.”

01:00:09.405 --> 01:00:11.207
“Oh Mi Seok.”

01:00:15.712 --> 01:00:17.213
“Mi Sook.”

01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:21.451
“Mi Sook.”

01:00:22.085 --> 01:00:22.952
"Mi Sook"...

01:00:35.531 --> 01:00:36.666
“Mi Sook.”

01:00:37.634 --> 01:00:38.801
“Mi Sook.”

01:00:45.341 --> 01:00:48.911
Soo Jin, you're getting bone marrow.

01:00:49.879 --> 01:00:52.849
We found a matching donor.

01:00:53.683 --> 01:00:54.951
Really, mom?

01:00:56.252 --> 01:00:59.589
Soo Jin, your comfortable life is over.

01:01:00.456 --> 01:01:02.959
Once you have the bone marrow surgery at 26 and come out...

01:01:07.363 --> 01:01:09.198
Soo Jin, why are you crying? What's wrong?

01:01:10.133 --> 01:01:12.035
I don't know

01:01:12.568 --> 01:01:15.138
What does the sky look like?

01:01:16.172 --> 01:01:18.307
You won't be there.

01:01:18.875 --> 01:01:21.344
And Mr. Lim won't be there either.

01:01:21.911 --> 01:01:25.214
So I was afraid to go alone.

01:01:29.152 --> 01:01:31.320
- Were you afraid? - Yes.

01:01:36.693 --> 01:01:37.860
I understand that.

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.662
I didn't even know that.

01:01:41.497 --> 01:01:44.033
I'm sorry.

01:01:45.735 --> 01:01:47.136
I didn't know you were afraid.

01:02:35.451 --> 01:02:36.452
What?

01:02:37.153 --> 01:02:38.321
What happened?

01:02:43.326 --> 01:02:44.460
“Mi Sook.”

01:02:48.865 --> 01:02:50.466
“Mi Sook.”

01:03:05.248 --> 01:03:06.382
It wasn't me!

01:03:06.849 --> 01:03:09.418
I didn't kill her! I have been framed!

01:03:09.652 --> 01:03:10.953
It wasn't me!

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:13.256
I will be able to live!

01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:15.958
Who is the donor who will save Soo Jin's life?

01:03:16.025 --> 01:03:17.360
It is assumed to be anonymous.

01:03:17.627 --> 01:03:19.629
Framing him is not enough. What about Park Jae-kyung?

01:03:19.796 --> 01:03:21.831
I told you I would catch you.

01:03:21.931 --> 01:03:24.367
Make sure Jang Tae San stays silent.

01:03:24.901 --> 01:03:28.137
What if something happens to the donor?

01:03:28.237 --> 01:03:30.807
What if he gets sick or gets into a car accident?

01:03:31.073 --> 01:03:32.708
You will die instantly.

01:03:33.509 --> 01:03:35.511
