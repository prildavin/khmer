00:00:00.768 --> 00:00:03.034
(The 3rd Year of King Gojong’s Reign.)

00:00:03.034 --> 00:00:05.468
(In Joseon, when conflicts between reformists)

00:00:05.468 --> 00:00:07.835
(and conservatives are soaring high,)

00:00:07.835 --> 00:00:10.001
(members of the reformists, who supported)

00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:12.268
(King Gojong’s Open Door Policy, are being)

00:00:12.268 --> 00:00:14.101
(shot one by one by a mysterious gunman...)

00:00:27.268 --> 00:00:31.568
He’ll definitely turn up.

00:00:33.134 --> 00:00:36.368
We’ll catch him tonight no matter what.

00:00:36.368 --> 00:00:38.034
Remember this.

00:00:39.401 --> 00:00:42.168
He’s a gunman.

00:00:42.168 --> 00:00:43.368
He operates a new style of gun

00:00:43.368 --> 00:00:45.401
from the West.

00:00:45.401 --> 00:00:47.401
Remember.

00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:50.401
If you have courage, you can catch him.

00:00:50.401 --> 00:00:51.835
Sir.

00:00:54.134 --> 00:00:56.568
I found out where they’re gathering.

00:00:59.535 --> 00:01:01.334
Let’s go.

00:01:07.735 --> 00:01:11.034
‘Let’s close the door and protect Joseon.’

00:01:11.034 --> 00:01:13.168
Don’t let that phrase fool you.

00:01:13.168 --> 00:01:16.835
What they’re protecting is neither the spirit

00:01:16.835 --> 00:01:18.201
nor the tradition of Joseon.

00:01:18.201 --> 00:01:19.535
You, go to the front. You, go inside.

00:01:19.535 --> 00:01:20.701
Yes, sir!

00:01:22.334 --> 00:01:24.601
What they really want is to keep their power

00:01:24.601 --> 00:01:28.701
that they’ve enjoyed for generations,

00:01:28.701 --> 00:01:31.468
and the wealth that they took

00:01:31.468 --> 00:01:32.934
from the commoners.

00:01:32.934 --> 00:01:36.768
Aye! Aye!

00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:44.934
Opening the door is our only option.

00:01:44.934 --> 00:01:47.201
Look how strong Japan has gotten.

00:01:47.201 --> 00:01:50.434
Look how weak Joseon has gotten.

00:01:50.434 --> 00:01:54.034
Joseon has to open its doors now.

00:01:54.034 --> 00:01:58.368
We need to join the new world.

00:01:58.368 --> 00:02:03.735
- Aye! / - Aye!

00:02:12.501 --> 00:02:18.434
This is a critical time for Joseon.

00:02:18.434 --> 00:02:22.635
Depending on how we prepare

00:02:22.635 --> 00:02:24.568
for the new world,

00:02:24.568 --> 00:02:28.234
the future of Joseon will be decided.

00:02:39.067 --> 00:02:44.468
Opening the door will involve hardships,

00:02:44.468 --> 00:02:48.401
but we have to overcome them,

00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:50.735
no matter what.

00:02:50.735 --> 00:02:54.201
Somebody’s got to start,

00:02:54.201 --> 00:02:57.034
and we can be those people.

00:02:57.034 --> 00:02:59.768
Let’s build a new Joseon.

00:02:59.768 --> 00:03:03.034
Joseon has to go forward...

00:03:15.401 --> 00:03:16.802
It’s a gun!

00:03:16.802 --> 00:03:19.168
Master! Master Hyeonam!

00:03:22.234 --> 00:03:23.768
It’s a gun!

00:03:27.301 --> 00:03:29.301
Master! Master!

00:03:29.301 --> 00:03:31.334
You can’t die now, sir!

00:03:31.334 --> 00:03:33.201
- Master! / - Master!

00:06:24.501 --> 00:06:27.568
Sir! Sir!

00:06:28.835 --> 00:06:30.034
Sir!

00:06:40.201 --> 00:06:41.401
Sir!

00:06:48.001 --> 00:06:49.034
Sir!

00:06:50.234 --> 00:06:51.668
Are you okay?

00:07:10.459 --> 00:07:11.897
(Episode 1)

00:07:15.835 --> 00:07:19.301
We’ve lost three people in the past month.

00:07:20.434 --> 00:07:24.902
(King Gojong) Songha, Jeolgang, and recently Hyeonam.

00:07:24.902 --> 00:07:27.601
They were the scholars I wanted to hire.

00:07:27.601 --> 00:07:29.268
I needed them for the enlightenment

00:07:29.268 --> 00:07:31.067
and reformation of Joseon.

00:07:31.067 --> 00:07:35.501
What are you guys doing?

00:07:37.835 --> 00:07:40.368
Answer me, Minister Kim!

00:07:40.368 --> 00:07:44.201
Aren’t you in charge of this case?

00:07:44.201 --> 00:07:45.934
Your Majesty,

00:07:45.934 --> 00:07:49.201
we’re working hard to find this guy.

00:07:49.201 --> 00:07:51.067
We’ll catch him soon.

00:07:51.067 --> 00:07:53.967
Don’t be too concerned.

00:07:53.967 --> 00:07:57.268
Don’t be too concerned?

00:07:57.268 --> 00:07:59.934
Is that all you have to say?

00:08:00.967 --> 00:08:02.434
(Kim Byeongje / Minister, the Conservatives)

00:08:03.934 --> 00:08:05.635
Listen to me carefully.

00:08:05.635 --> 00:08:10.334
We’ll catch this guy for sure, and find out

00:08:10.334 --> 00:08:12.568
who he’s working for, if there’s anyone.

00:08:12.568 --> 00:08:16.535
I can promise you this.

00:08:16.535 --> 00:08:19.835
Your Majesty, you’re absolutely right,

00:08:19.835 --> 00:08:21.501
and I support you.

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:25.101
We’ll do whatever we can to find him.

00:08:25.101 --> 00:08:27.967
Please trust us, Your Majesty!

00:08:39.301 --> 00:08:42.501
Who’s left now?

00:08:43.601 --> 00:08:46.268
Ogyeong Lee Namju is still alive,

00:08:46.268 --> 00:08:49.201
but we don’t know his whereabouts.

00:08:50.201 --> 00:08:51.768
I’m sorry, Your Majesty!

00:08:51.768 --> 00:08:53.802
On the day Hyeonam died,

00:08:53.802 --> 00:08:56.001
I sent my men to his place,

00:08:56.001 --> 00:08:58.868
but he was already gone.

00:08:58.868 --> 00:09:01.168
Find him and protect him.

00:09:01.168 --> 00:09:04.835
Catch the shooter as soon as possible.

00:09:04.835 --> 00:09:05.902
Yes, Your Majesty!

00:09:06.635 --> 00:09:11.201
Remember. This is an attack on me.

00:09:11.201 --> 00:09:14.067
Those who want to defeat me are doing this.

00:09:15.101 --> 00:09:17.768
I’ll risk my life to find him, Your Majesty!

00:09:43.668 --> 00:09:44.701
Please come again.

00:09:44.701 --> 00:09:46.201
I’ll see you later.

00:09:46.902 --> 00:09:49.568
I haven’t seen you for a long time, sir.

00:09:56.501 --> 00:09:57.934
Question everyone!

00:09:57.934 --> 00:10:00.401
We have to find even the smallest clue.

00:10:00.401 --> 00:10:02.101
No matter how small it may seem,

00:10:02.101 --> 00:10:04.735
if it’s related to the gunman, check into it.

00:10:04.735 --> 00:10:05.701
Yes, sir!

00:10:43.802 --> 00:10:47.967
Don’t worry. I’ll only cut the flowers.

00:10:47.967 --> 00:10:51.368
Relax and keep your eyes closed.

00:11:43.868 --> 00:11:45.401
If you enjoyed yourselves,

00:11:45.401 --> 00:11:47.134
why don’t you pay for her top?

00:11:47.134 --> 00:11:48.601
Of course.

00:11:48.601 --> 00:11:49.535
Here!

00:11:51.101 --> 00:11:52.434
Here!

00:11:52.434 --> 00:11:53.635
Take it!

00:11:53.635 --> 00:11:54.868
Here!

00:12:12.134 --> 00:12:14.334
What do you think you’re doing?

00:12:14.334 --> 00:12:17.168
Did you learn how to use a sword to do this?

00:12:17.168 --> 00:12:19.168
What have I done wrong?

00:12:19.168 --> 00:12:22.768
At least I’m making money with my sword.

00:12:22.768 --> 00:12:24.701
You’ve got to stop this.

00:12:28.635 --> 00:12:30.101
If you have nothing more to say,

00:12:30.101 --> 00:12:31.868
I’m going to go.

00:12:32.835 --> 00:12:35.234
Behave yourself.

00:12:35.234 --> 00:12:36.835
Serious crimes happen all the time.

00:12:36.835 --> 00:12:39.034
Yes. I know.

00:12:39.601 --> 00:12:41.468
I also know that you’ve wasted the entire month

00:12:41.468 --> 00:12:44.301
trying to catch that gunman.

00:12:44.301 --> 00:12:46.668
Don’t worry about your foolish son,

00:12:46.668 --> 00:12:49.201
and catch that criminal, why don’t you?

00:12:49.201 --> 00:12:51.635
If you’ll excuse me.

00:12:54.501 --> 00:12:56.101
Don’t even think about doing

00:12:56.101 --> 00:12:58.034
anything stupid.

00:12:58.034 --> 00:13:00.401
He’s way out of your league.

00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:14.902
This is...

00:13:16.835 --> 00:13:18.401
Take it.

00:13:18.401 --> 00:13:19.535
You’re disguised as a man

00:13:19.535 --> 00:13:20.934
and have come to me.

00:13:20.934 --> 00:13:23.468
I’m assuming you’re up to no good.

00:13:25.101 --> 00:13:26.268
Come on.

00:13:26.902 --> 00:13:29.668
You don’t know what you’re getting into.

00:13:31.501 --> 00:13:32.668
Thank you.

00:13:33.234 --> 00:13:34.701
No worries.

00:13:40.902 --> 00:13:44.501
It was a pleasure doing business with you, sir.

00:13:44.501 --> 00:13:47.802
I’ll see you around, ma’am.

00:14:02.934 --> 00:14:04.735
Are you okay?

00:14:06.468 --> 00:14:08.902
I’m sorry. Are you hurt?

00:14:10.101 --> 00:14:12.168
I didn’t think I hit you that hard.

00:14:20.635 --> 00:14:22.401
What a wuss!

00:15:37.934 --> 00:15:41.067
I heard that Ogyeong often comes here.

00:15:41.067 --> 00:15:45.301
He does, but he wouldn’t at a time like this.

00:15:46.468 --> 00:15:50.535
Everybody’s saying that it’s his turn now.

00:15:52.501 --> 00:15:57.334
If he ever comes here, can you give this to him?

00:15:59.067 --> 00:16:00.401
Okay.

00:16:00.401 --> 00:16:02.201
Thank you.

00:16:18.934 --> 00:16:21.101
We meet again.

00:16:22.368 --> 00:16:25.301
Did I hurt you earlier?

00:16:25.301 --> 00:16:26.468
I’m fine.

00:16:30.635 --> 00:16:32.234
What are you doing?

00:16:32.234 --> 00:16:34.034
I’ve followed you

00:16:34.034 --> 00:16:36.735
from gisaeng houses to bookstores.

00:16:36.735 --> 00:16:38.334
You’ve gone to places

00:16:38.334 --> 00:16:40.101
where a scholar might visit.

00:16:40.101 --> 00:16:43.201
You’ve been avoiding the patrol officers.

00:16:44.168 --> 00:16:45.668
Who are you

00:16:45.668 --> 00:16:47.434
and why are you following me?

00:16:48.334 --> 00:16:50.368
I was curious.

00:16:50.368 --> 00:16:53.735
What a guy with a gun would do.

00:17:03.768 --> 00:17:05.835
Your wrist is slim,

00:17:05.835 --> 00:17:07.868
so you can’t be the assassin.

00:17:07.868 --> 00:17:09.835
Who the heck are you?

00:17:09.835 --> 00:17:11.034
Let go of me.

00:17:11.034 --> 00:17:14.201
I guess he’d need someone like you,

00:17:14.201 --> 00:17:17.001
to collect information for him.

00:17:19.902 --> 00:17:22.067
Take me to the gunman.

00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:24.868
I want to meet him.

00:17:25.802 --> 00:17:27.334
You’ve got the wrong person.

00:17:28.301 --> 00:17:29.468
I don’t think so.

00:17:38.101 --> 00:17:39.535
How dare he!

00:17:59.034 --> 00:18:02.601
Let me go. Get off of me.

00:18:04.268 --> 00:18:04.967
Stop!

00:18:04.967 --> 00:18:07.234
I’m Han Jeonghun from the Police Bureau.

00:18:10.101 --> 00:18:12.168
What are you waiting for? Arrest them all.

00:18:12.168 --> 00:18:13.368
Yes, sir!

00:18:17.535 --> 00:18:19.701
(Police Bureau)

00:18:19.701 --> 00:18:21.701
Sit down! Sit down!

00:18:21.701 --> 00:18:23.168
Hey! Sit down!

00:18:24.134 --> 00:18:25.501
Sit down!

00:18:31.301 --> 00:18:32.802
Who are they?

00:18:32.802 --> 00:18:34.368
This is a conflict between

00:18:34.368 --> 00:18:35.967
two groups of peddlers.

00:18:35.967 --> 00:18:37.668
They don’t get along.

00:18:37.668 --> 00:18:38.701
Why not?

00:18:38.701 --> 00:18:41.701
It’s a turf war. Let’s go inside.

00:18:56.835 --> 00:18:59.835
You met a spy for the gunman?

00:18:59.835 --> 00:19:05.268
Yes. I’ll catch that rat next time for sure.

00:19:05.268 --> 00:19:07.034
Don’t bother.

00:19:07.034 --> 00:19:07.568
What?

00:19:07.568 --> 00:19:08.668
Stay out of it.

00:19:08.668 --> 00:19:11.067
What if you meet the real gunman?

00:19:12.301 --> 00:19:13.902
You’re supposed to catch him.

00:19:13.902 --> 00:19:16.101
I don’t want to die.

00:19:16.101 --> 00:19:17.635
I’ll avoid him as long as I can.

00:19:18.934 --> 00:19:20.701
He’s using a modern style gun.

00:19:20.701 --> 00:19:21.902
It’s different than a matchlock.

00:19:21.902 --> 00:19:23.902
It’s hundred times stronger and faster.

00:19:23.902 --> 00:19:25.601
Avoid it if you can.

00:19:25.601 --> 00:19:27.368
What if I catch him?

00:19:27.368 --> 00:19:30.902
Well, I’ll give you Myeongwol.

00:19:31.868 --> 00:19:32.967
Is Myeongwol yours?

00:19:32.967 --> 00:19:34.967
She’s not. That’s why I’m giving her to you.

00:19:38.368 --> 00:19:39.668
What are you doing?

00:19:42.001 --> 00:19:43.934
You’re pretty quick.

00:19:43.934 --> 00:19:46.067
A modern style gun is slower than you.

00:19:48.301 --> 00:19:49.635
I have to go.

00:20:25.501 --> 00:20:27.301
Take me to the gunman.

00:20:27.301 --> 00:20:28.701
Where are you going?

00:20:45.001 --> 00:20:47.468
What have you done now?

00:20:47.468 --> 00:20:49.835
I don’t want to talk about it.

00:20:51.101 --> 00:20:53.401
You’ve got to stop this.

00:20:53.401 --> 00:20:55.468
You’re making me nervous.

00:20:57.101 --> 00:21:00.668
When your mother asked me to fetch you,

00:21:00.668 --> 00:21:02.701
I didn’t know what to do.

00:21:04.601 --> 00:21:06.635
I had to lie through my teeth

00:21:06.635 --> 00:21:07.701
to your mother.

00:21:13.768 --> 00:21:17.268
Lady Suin, what’s this?

00:21:19.268 --> 00:21:20.067
It was given to me.

00:21:20.067 --> 00:21:21.934
Who gave it to you?

00:21:21.934 --> 00:21:23.334
Hyewon.

00:21:27.334 --> 00:21:29.768
You shouldn’t have accepted

00:21:29.768 --> 00:21:31.601
that hideous thing.

00:21:31.601 --> 00:21:33.668
I got it because I’m scared.

00:21:33.668 --> 00:21:35.201
I’m trying to find Master Ogyeong,

00:21:35.201 --> 00:21:37.735
and I don’t feel safe.

00:21:37.735 --> 00:21:42.601
I feel like that gunman is following me.

00:21:42.601 --> 00:21:46.168
That’s why I want you to stop.

00:21:46.168 --> 00:21:49.201
Don’t risk your life over a book.

00:21:50.201 --> 00:21:51.668
Stop it!

00:21:55.401 --> 00:21:57.301
That’s Master Hyeonam’s book.

00:21:57.301 --> 00:22:00.401
He left it to me.

00:22:00.401 --> 00:22:02.434
I need to give it to him.

00:22:02.434 --> 00:22:05.034
I’m just worried.

00:22:05.034 --> 00:22:08.768
What if you actually run into that gunman?

00:22:08.768 --> 00:22:11.268
Don’t even say that.

00:22:12.668 --> 00:22:14.101
I’m scared.

00:22:19.768 --> 00:22:21.301
If those reformists take

00:22:21.301 --> 00:22:23.201
important government positions,

00:22:23.201 --> 00:22:26.601
our people will be kicked out of the palace.

00:22:27.268 --> 00:22:29.334
That’s not it.

00:22:29.334 --> 00:22:32.301
It’s easy to talk about reform and change.

00:22:32.301 --> 00:22:35.201
Who’s going to pay the expenses?

00:22:35.201 --> 00:22:38.001
They’re going to ask us, the nobility,

00:22:38.001 --> 00:22:40.835
to pay for everything.

00:22:40.835 --> 00:22:42.802
We’ve had enough.

00:22:44.001 --> 00:22:46.401
You have to make your decision now.

00:22:46.401 --> 00:22:49.034
Why don’t we bring his father back...

00:22:53.368 --> 00:22:56.701
(Kim Jwayeong) Don’t be too impatient.

00:22:59.835 --> 00:23:05.368
Enthroning a new king isn’t hard,

00:23:05.368 --> 00:23:09.601
but it’ll take time to tame him.

00:23:09.601 --> 00:23:12.635
That’s a hassle that we don’t want.

00:23:14.168 --> 00:23:15.134
What are you suggesting?

00:23:15.134 --> 00:23:18.101
Give him some time.

00:23:18.101 --> 00:23:20.802
Let him learn on his own.

00:23:21.835 --> 00:23:23.568
If he sees Ogyeong,

00:23:23.568 --> 00:23:26.468
the last person he relies on, die,

00:23:26.468 --> 00:23:30.268
he’ll get discouraged.

00:23:35.201 --> 00:23:39.201
Anything else?

00:23:39.201 --> 00:23:43.501
(Kim Byungjae) His Majesty himself hired Park Jinhan,

00:23:43.501 --> 00:23:45.668
as head of the Palace Patrol,

00:23:45.668 --> 00:23:48.468
and he’s digging deep into this case.

00:23:48.468 --> 00:23:50.735
If we let him do that...

00:23:50.735 --> 00:23:54.101
Those guys who we hired will

00:23:54.101 --> 00:23:56.201
take care of him.

00:23:57.034 --> 00:24:00.768
I told them to get rid of anyone

00:24:00.768 --> 00:24:03.134
who gets in the way.

00:24:03.134 --> 00:24:04.735
Yes, sir.

00:24:09.134 --> 00:24:12.101
Go ahead and have some tea.

00:24:13.368 --> 00:24:15.635
How’s your foot?

00:24:15.635 --> 00:24:19.201
It’ll take a few days to get better.

00:24:19.201 --> 00:24:20.401
Sorry.

00:24:22.201 --> 00:24:26.268
You take care of this now.

00:24:27.434 --> 00:24:28.001
Yes, sir.

00:24:28.001 --> 00:24:31.334
Did you find out where Park Jinhan lives?

00:24:31.334 --> 00:24:31.967
Yes, sir.

00:24:31.967 --> 00:24:33.934
Get rid of him first.

00:24:35.201 --> 00:24:38.168
Ogyeong is next.

00:24:38.168 --> 00:24:40.368
Yes, sir.

00:24:45.168 --> 00:24:47.001
(Muwiso) This is it.

00:24:47.001 --> 00:24:49.967
This is the only modern gun we have.

00:24:49.967 --> 00:24:51.568
We got it from America

00:24:51.568 --> 00:24:54.168
during their invasion in 1871.

00:24:54.168 --> 00:24:55.835
As you know...

00:24:57.268 --> 00:24:59.868
The only thing you have to do is

00:24:59.868 --> 00:25:01.735
pulling the trigger.

00:25:01.735 --> 00:25:02.868
You don’t have to ignite or

00:25:02.868 --> 00:25:04.101
fill the gun powder

00:25:04.101 --> 00:25:06.601
like you do with a matchlock.

00:25:06.601 --> 00:25:08.268
Even if gets completely wet,

00:25:08.268 --> 00:25:10.468
you can still fire it within a few minutes.

00:25:10.468 --> 00:25:14.301
To beat this, what do we have to use?

00:25:15.268 --> 00:25:18.368
We have nothing in Joseon that can beat this.

00:25:19.768 --> 00:25:22.168
You know what happened in 1871.

00:25:40.668 --> 00:25:44.535
They fired on us from where our arrows

00:25:44.535 --> 00:25:46.535
and matchlocks couldn’t reach.

00:25:47.967 --> 00:25:53.234
While 350 of us dies, they only lost 3.

00:25:54.635 --> 00:26:00.168
If you run into him again, you have to run.

00:26:00.168 --> 00:26:03.967
You’ve been incredibly lucky so far.

00:26:09.101 --> 00:26:10.902
Isn’t he coming home today, either?

00:26:10.902 --> 00:26:13.067
It’s been over 10 days.

00:26:14.701 --> 00:26:17.334
Aren’t you worried about father?

00:26:17.334 --> 00:26:21.735
Why should I be? It’s only been 10 days.

00:26:21.735 --> 00:26:22.934
While he was guarding the border,

00:26:22.934 --> 00:26:24.835
he didn’t come home for 10 months.

00:26:25.568 --> 00:26:29.802
Even on the day you and I were born.

00:26:29.802 --> 00:26:31.434
He was busy working.

00:26:32.134 --> 00:26:34.934
But he’s never done it

00:26:34.934 --> 00:26:37.334
since we came to the capital.

00:26:37.334 --> 00:26:40.535
I guess he’s got a very important job to do.

00:26:40.535 --> 00:26:43.234
There’s a gunman around.

00:26:43.234 --> 00:26:45.934
I hope he’s not chasing him.

00:26:49.635 --> 00:26:51.101
There.

00:26:51.967 --> 00:26:53.101
Look!

00:26:54.134 --> 00:26:56.201
What is it?

00:26:56.201 --> 00:26:57.301
Guess what it is.

00:26:58.234 --> 00:26:59.368
A pot?

00:27:00.701 --> 00:27:02.535
It’s an owl.

00:27:02.535 --> 00:27:04.134
No way.

00:27:04.134 --> 00:27:06.568
It looks like a pot to me.

00:27:06.568 --> 00:27:10.001
When an owl folds its wings,

00:27:10.001 --> 00:27:12.802
it looks like a pot like this.

00:27:12.802 --> 00:27:16.902
Look at this! It has eyes and ears as well.

00:27:16.902 --> 00:27:21.067
I want it with its wings spread.

00:27:21.067 --> 00:27:22.434
Wings spread?

00:27:31.268 --> 00:27:32.802
Look! This is nice.

00:27:33.868 --> 00:27:36.334
I said wings spread.

00:27:50.001 --> 00:27:51.468
I think he’s home.

00:28:03.301 --> 00:28:04.967
Father.

00:28:04.967 --> 00:28:06.034
Uh.

00:28:09.201 --> 00:28:10.768
How was work?

00:28:10.768 --> 00:28:13.301
Good. How was your day?

00:28:13.301 --> 00:28:14.601
Good.

00:28:29.001 --> 00:28:30.468
Take her inside.

00:28:32.301 --> 00:28:33.301
Father.

00:28:35.735 --> 00:28:36.934
Father.

00:28:43.067 --> 00:28:44.768
Yeonha, get inside.

00:28:44.768 --> 00:28:45.735
Okay.

00:29:50.334 --> 00:29:52.168
So, we finally meet.

00:31:27.768 --> 00:31:29.134
Stand back.

00:31:30.468 --> 00:31:31.768
Stand back.

00:32:00.768 --> 00:32:01.601
That’s him.

00:32:01.601 --> 00:32:02.835
Yes, sir.

00:32:47.334 --> 00:32:48.668
This is it!

00:32:48.668 --> 00:32:49.701
Surround the house.

00:32:49.701 --> 00:32:50.601
Yes, sir.

00:32:50.601 --> 00:32:51.668
Surround the house!

00:32:51.668 --> 00:32:52.668
Yes, sir.

00:33:01.134 --> 00:33:02.568
What’s going on?

00:33:10.034 --> 00:33:12.368
Move! We’re with the Palace Patrol.

00:33:15.434 --> 00:33:16.701
What’s going on?

00:33:16.701 --> 00:33:19.501
The guy we were chasing came into this place.

00:33:19.501 --> 00:33:21.334
We need to search your premises.

00:33:21.334 --> 00:33:23.401
This is the headquarters of Gyeonggi Peddlers

00:33:23.401 --> 00:33:25.101
Guild and the house of the head.

00:33:25.101 --> 00:33:28.368
You can’t search without permission.

00:33:28.368 --> 00:33:30.201
If you stop us, we’ll kill you.

00:33:30.201 --> 00:33:31.268
Stop!

00:33:34.468 --> 00:33:36.934
Who were you chasing, sir?

00:33:36.934 --> 00:33:39.268
A gunman wearing a bamboo hat.

00:33:40.101 --> 00:33:40.934
Well...

00:33:40.934 --> 00:33:42.934
Will you cooperate?

00:33:43.535 --> 00:33:44.434
Of course!

00:33:44.434 --> 00:33:47.334
A guy like him isn’t welcome here, either.

00:33:47.334 --> 00:33:50.101
Open all the doors in the house.

00:33:50.101 --> 00:33:51.768
Open all the big boxes where

00:33:51.768 --> 00:33:53.368
a human could hide.

00:34:03.368 --> 00:34:05.034
Please go ahead.

00:34:32.934 --> 00:34:34.134
He’s not here.

00:34:56.134 --> 00:34:57.568
I couldn’t find anything.

00:35:06.468 --> 00:35:08.234
Sorry for the inconvenience.

00:35:09.067 --> 00:35:11.201
I’m glad that I’m off the hook.

00:35:12.034 --> 00:35:13.301
Thank you for your cooperation.

00:35:13.301 --> 00:35:14.768
No worries.

00:35:14.768 --> 00:35:17.168
Thank you for working hard so late at night.

00:35:17.168 --> 00:35:18.501
Take care.

00:35:21.001 --> 00:35:21.967
Bye.

00:35:32.934 --> 00:35:35.835
Don’t be too upset about it.

00:35:35.835 --> 00:35:38.368
Let it go.

00:35:38.368 --> 00:35:40.201
Sure.

00:35:40.201 --> 00:35:42.668
If that’s what you want. I guess I should.

00:35:42.668 --> 00:35:45.768
Why don’t you go inside, father?

00:35:55.902 --> 00:35:59.201
I think that bastard fooled us and escaped.

00:35:59.201 --> 00:36:01.668
Divide into two teams and keep following him.

00:36:01.668 --> 00:36:04.034
Check all the roads to the castle gates.

00:36:04.034 --> 00:36:04.934
Yes, sir.

00:36:10.535 --> 00:36:14.334
You shouldn’t be alone from now on.

00:36:14.334 --> 00:36:18.768
I think that bastard is after you now.

00:36:28.001 --> 00:36:29.535
Come on out.

00:36:40.501 --> 00:36:42.635
Don’t enter this house ever again

00:36:42.635 --> 00:36:44.835
even in case of being chased.

00:36:47.368 --> 00:36:49.635
If you make the same mistake again,

00:36:49.635 --> 00:36:53.568
I’m going to punish you both.

00:36:53.568 --> 00:36:54.802
I’m so sorry.

00:36:56.101 --> 00:36:57.967
Get out.

00:36:57.967 --> 00:36:59.835
They’ve gone far enough.

00:37:14.401 --> 00:37:18.301
Do you understand? Pack the essentials.

00:37:18.301 --> 00:37:19.101
Yes.

00:37:19.101 --> 00:37:20.301
Okay.

00:37:22.635 --> 00:37:24.501
You, too.

00:37:24.501 --> 00:37:26.635
It’s too dangerous for you to stay here.

00:37:27.401 --> 00:37:28.768
I’m staying here.

00:37:30.101 --> 00:37:32.001
I’m not running away.

00:37:32.001 --> 00:37:34.134
If you don’t go, Yeonha won’t go, either.

00:37:34.134 --> 00:37:36.468
Do you think she’ll go without you?

00:37:38.868 --> 00:37:41.768
Where on earth are you taking us?

00:37:45.501 --> 00:37:47.268
Sorry for the inconvenience.

00:37:47.835 --> 00:37:51.268
Don’t mention it. You’re always welcome here.

00:37:52.535 --> 00:37:55.601
This is Mr. Jeong Hoeryeong, an interpreter,

00:37:55.601 --> 00:37:57.168
and his wife.

00:37:59.401 --> 00:38:00.902
I’m Park Yungang.

00:38:04.468 --> 00:38:06.234
I’m Park Yeonha.

00:38:06.234 --> 00:38:08.768
Thank you for taking us in.

00:38:10.101 --> 00:38:12.368
You’re such a polite girl.

00:38:12.368 --> 00:38:13.668
Make yourself at home.

00:38:17.468 --> 00:38:20.601
Your father and I are very close.

00:38:20.601 --> 00:38:22.368
I was attacked on my way to Qing while

00:38:22.368 --> 00:38:24.668
traveling with envoys and your father,

00:38:24.668 --> 00:38:26.902
who was guarding the border,

00:38:26.902 --> 00:38:29.301
saved my life.

00:38:29.301 --> 00:38:30.735
I’m trying to repay my debt.

00:38:30.735 --> 00:38:31.868
Make yourself at home.

00:38:32.668 --> 00:38:34.768
Thank you.

00:38:35.401 --> 00:38:37.768
Excuse me, but Lady Suin is here.

00:38:37.768 --> 00:38:40.168
Okay. Send her in.

00:38:50.768 --> 00:38:53.501
My father’s told me a lot about you.

00:39:21.735 --> 00:39:23.868
I’m sorry. I was being rude.

00:39:23.868 --> 00:39:26.001
You look like someone I know.

00:39:26.967 --> 00:39:30.501
How do you know a young man like him?

00:39:33.268 --> 00:39:35.468
I guess your son is so handsome

00:39:35.468 --> 00:39:37.768
that she must’ve been shocked.

00:39:39.802 --> 00:39:41.268
Stop joking.

00:39:43.468 --> 00:39:47.701
Suin, why don’t you show him around?

00:39:47.701 --> 00:39:51.768
Sorry? Ah, okay.

00:39:59.134 --> 00:40:00.601
This is your room.

00:40:00.601 --> 00:40:02.967
Yeonha will share my room.

00:40:02.967 --> 00:40:04.535
Thank you.

00:40:04.535 --> 00:40:06.501
Get some rest.

00:40:09.934 --> 00:40:10.668
Excuse me.

00:40:12.668 --> 00:40:14.401
What is it?

00:40:14.401 --> 00:40:17.434
Have we, by any chance, met before?

00:40:18.201 --> 00:40:19.967
I don’t think so.

00:40:19.967 --> 00:40:22.768
I’ve never met you before.

00:40:22.768 --> 00:40:27.334
You said I looked like someone you know,

00:40:27.334 --> 00:40:29.001
and I think I feel the same way.

00:40:29.735 --> 00:40:31.802
We might have bumped into

00:40:31.802 --> 00:40:33.635
each other on the street.

00:40:33.635 --> 00:40:37.934
Right. That must be it. Excuse me.

00:40:37.934 --> 00:40:39.001
By the way.

00:40:40.401 --> 00:40:41.201
Yes?

00:40:42.001 --> 00:40:44.101
Who’s that guy who looks like me?

00:40:44.101 --> 00:40:45.768
I’m just curious.

00:40:47.067 --> 00:40:48.701
Well...

00:40:48.701 --> 00:40:52.101
Never mind. It’s not important.

00:40:54.168 --> 00:40:57.301
Actually, I bumped into a scoundrel

00:40:57.301 --> 00:40:58.701
a few days ago.

00:40:58.701 --> 00:41:00.501
He was so violent and rude

00:41:00.501 --> 00:41:03.001
that I don’t even want to even mention it.

00:41:03.001 --> 00:41:05.868
When I think of him, I start shaking.

00:41:05.868 --> 00:41:07.067
What?

00:41:07.067 --> 00:41:11.434
But you’re not him anyway.

00:41:11.434 --> 00:41:12.568
Excuse me.

00:41:20.067 --> 00:41:23.234
How dare she compare me to a scoundrel?

00:41:28.301 --> 00:41:31.134
You seem excited.

00:41:31.134 --> 00:41:32.535
What?

00:41:32.535 --> 00:41:34.501
He’s so handsome

00:41:34.501 --> 00:41:38.034
with tight lips, and penetrating eyes.

00:41:39.168 --> 00:41:44.535
I’m sure he’ll attract some girls.

00:41:44.535 --> 00:41:46.434
Nonsense.

00:41:46.434 --> 00:41:47.535
Why?

00:41:48.601 --> 00:41:51.401
He’s not so interested in you?

00:41:52.001 --> 00:41:54.401
What? Hey!

00:41:54.401 --> 00:41:56.201
Nothing. Get some rest.

00:41:56.902 --> 00:41:59.701
Hey! Stop right there!

00:42:04.668 --> 00:42:05.835
Mother.

00:42:09.568 --> 00:42:12.668
Mother, I don’t dislike him.

00:42:12.668 --> 00:42:14.468
Why would I dislike him?

00:42:14.468 --> 00:42:16.001
I didn’t do anything.

00:42:16.001 --> 00:42:17.902
You didn’t do anything?

00:42:17.902 --> 00:42:20.568
As soon as you saw Yungang’s face,

00:42:20.568 --> 00:42:22.034
you frowned.

00:42:22.735 --> 00:42:25.868
I was so embarrassed in front of his father.

00:42:27.802 --> 00:42:30.735
He saved your father’s life.

00:42:30.735 --> 00:42:32.001
Don’t do anything

00:42:32.001 --> 00:42:34.234
that might make them uncomfortable.

00:42:37.067 --> 00:42:40.168
What does she want me to do?

00:42:40.168 --> 00:42:42.268
I’m trying hard not to be rude.

00:42:43.434 --> 00:42:46.334
Should I flirt with him or something?

00:42:46.334 --> 00:42:47.701
Darn it!

00:42:53.568 --> 00:42:54.802
Who’s there?

00:43:00.735 --> 00:43:01.601
It’s me.

00:43:01.601 --> 00:43:04.468
What are you doing hiding there?

00:43:06.568 --> 00:43:10.234
I’m not hiding. I was just looking around.

00:43:10.234 --> 00:43:11.835
These are the Lady’s Quarters.

00:43:11.835 --> 00:43:14.268
You’re not allowed to come in here.

00:43:14.268 --> 00:43:16.001
Didn’t you know that?

00:43:16.001 --> 00:43:18.868
Well... I was just...

00:43:21.301 --> 00:43:24.134
I saw some interesting things here.

00:43:25.101 --> 00:43:26.701
If you saw something interesting,

00:43:26.701 --> 00:43:28.668
would you barge into my room?

00:43:29.368 --> 00:43:31.735
Okay, okay. I’m leaving.

00:43:37.601 --> 00:43:42.934
I’m sorry about what happened earlier.

00:43:42.934 --> 00:43:45.967
I heard your mother giving you an earful.

00:43:45.967 --> 00:43:48.835
Eavesdropping, hiding. What else?

00:43:48.835 --> 00:43:53.268
I didn’t mean to,

00:43:53.268 --> 00:43:55.368
but I’ll apologize if I offended you.

00:43:56.568 --> 00:43:59.201
I didn’t want to cause any inconvenience,

00:43:59.201 --> 00:44:01.434
but my father was so adamant.

00:44:01.434 --> 00:44:05.101
If you’re done talking, you can leave now.

00:44:05.101 --> 00:44:07.934
Okay. Sorry for the inconvenience.

00:44:10.568 --> 00:44:12.001
What a temper!

00:44:12.001 --> 00:44:14.535
What did I do so terribly wrong?

00:44:14.535 --> 00:44:15.701
What?

00:44:17.535 --> 00:44:19.168
Nothing. Nothing.

00:44:20.701 --> 00:44:22.234
Unbelievable!

00:44:27.201 --> 00:44:28.334
Thank you.

00:44:28.835 --> 00:44:31.001
I’m so scared and worried.

00:44:31.001 --> 00:44:33.034
Do you think father will be okay?

00:44:33.701 --> 00:44:34.868
Don’t worry.

00:44:34.868 --> 00:44:37.835
He’s the best swordsman in Joseon.

00:44:37.835 --> 00:44:39.568
But he’s got a gun.

00:44:39.568 --> 00:44:41.001
You saw it yourself.

00:44:43.168 --> 00:44:44.934
Yeonha, he’s not only practicing

00:44:44.934 --> 00:44:46.934
how to use a sword.

00:44:46.934 --> 00:44:48.134
He also practices

00:44:48.134 --> 00:44:51.201
how to win in any kind of battle.

00:44:53.501 --> 00:44:55.601
He’ll be okay.

00:44:55.601 --> 00:44:57.234
You can trust me.

00:44:59.601 --> 00:45:00.468
Okay.

00:45:04.234 --> 00:45:05.334
That was good.

00:45:06.967 --> 00:45:08.735
Are you going out?

00:45:08.735 --> 00:45:10.868
Yes, I’m meeting Jeonghun.

00:45:10.868 --> 00:45:14.768
Come home early. This isn’t our house.

00:45:14.768 --> 00:45:16.768
Don’t bother these people late at night.

00:45:16.768 --> 00:45:18.468
Okay.

00:45:58.802 --> 00:46:00.201
I see you’ve come back.

00:46:01.434 --> 00:46:02.835
Yes.

00:46:02.835 --> 00:46:06.334
Has he, by any chance, been in?

00:46:06.334 --> 00:46:07.501
He, he hasn’t.

00:46:11.067 --> 00:46:13.501
Have you heard about him?

00:46:14.668 --> 00:46:15.468
Please?

00:46:15.468 --> 00:46:18.535
I heard that someone saw him in Banchon.

00:46:18.535 --> 00:46:22.635
I think he’s planning something up there.

00:46:25.201 --> 00:46:26.568
Hello.

00:46:34.201 --> 00:46:36.067
(Banchon)

00:47:32.201 --> 00:47:33.868
Who are you?

00:47:33.868 --> 00:47:36.601
(Ogyeong Lee Namju) Why have you been following me?

00:47:39.668 --> 00:47:41.134
Hyeongam...

00:47:42.535 --> 00:47:44.268
Master Hyeonam.

00:47:48.934 --> 00:47:50.701
What did you just say?

00:47:52.101 --> 00:47:54.434
I learned from Master Hyeonam.

00:47:54.434 --> 00:47:55.967
Don’t lie to me.

00:47:55.967 --> 00:47:59.001
I know all of his students.

00:47:59.001 --> 00:48:02.401
I’m one of his students. I’m Suin.

00:48:03.301 --> 00:48:06.902
I’m the daughter of Jeong Hoeryeong.

00:48:06.902 --> 00:48:08.701
Don’t you recognize me?

00:48:08.701 --> 00:48:10.334
We’ve seen each other several times.

00:48:10.334 --> 00:48:13.201
What are you talking about? You’re a guy.

00:48:13.201 --> 00:48:15.234
I’m just dressed like a guy.

00:48:17.635 --> 00:48:18.735
Look at me!

00:48:23.535 --> 00:48:24.868
You’re right.

00:48:26.234 --> 00:48:27.768
You’ve gone through this much trouble

00:48:27.768 --> 00:48:29.768
to find me?

00:48:29.768 --> 00:48:33.168
I had to, to go where I needed to go.

00:48:33.168 --> 00:48:35.268
Where’s the book?

00:48:36.134 --> 00:48:38.568
I kept it at my place, just in case.

00:48:38.568 --> 00:48:40.034
Please come with me.

00:48:40.034 --> 00:48:43.468
He wanted me to give it to you.

00:48:43.468 --> 00:48:46.034
The night before he passed away.

00:48:47.468 --> 00:48:50.368
Not now. I have a meeting to go to.

00:48:50.368 --> 00:48:53.168
Everybody’s waiting for me.

00:48:53.168 --> 00:48:54.034
Well...

00:48:54.034 --> 00:48:55.134
Come to Angol when the curfew ends

00:48:55.134 --> 00:48:56.168
tomorrow.

00:48:56.168 --> 00:48:57.468
After you pass the Dongwon Bridge,

00:48:57.468 --> 00:48:58.835
there’s a big pine tree.

00:48:58.835 --> 00:49:00.034
I’ll meet you there.

00:49:00.034 --> 00:49:01.234
Can you meet me there?

00:49:01.234 --> 00:49:03.635
Of course, I’ll meet you there.

00:49:03.635 --> 00:49:05.501
Thank you.

00:49:14.768 --> 00:49:16.601
So you moved to a new place?

00:49:16.601 --> 00:49:17.368
Yes,

00:49:17.368 --> 00:49:20.001
I’m living in someone else’s house now.

00:49:20.001 --> 00:49:22.768
Anyway, I’m glad you’re okay.

00:49:24.501 --> 00:49:26.101
How is it living there?

00:49:26.101 --> 00:49:29.301
Does the owner have a beautiful daughter?

00:49:31.168 --> 00:49:33.001
You’re unbelievable!

00:49:33.001 --> 00:49:34.034
What?

00:49:34.034 --> 00:49:34.967
No?

00:49:36.934 --> 00:49:39.601
His daughter has a terrible temper.

00:49:40.234 --> 00:49:41.434
Is she pretty?

00:49:41.434 --> 00:49:42.802
I don’t know.

00:49:42.802 --> 00:49:44.234
Tell me.

00:49:46.735 --> 00:49:51.501
I guess she’s pretty.

00:49:51.501 --> 00:49:52.635
How pretty?

00:49:53.368 --> 00:49:54.401
Quite.

00:49:55.334 --> 00:49:57.902
but she’s got a bad temper.

00:49:57.902 --> 00:49:59.868
Don’t judge her by her disposition.

00:49:59.868 --> 00:50:02.034
That can change.

00:50:02.701 --> 00:50:03.568
What about her face?

00:50:03.568 --> 00:50:04.668
That never changes.

00:50:04.668 --> 00:50:06.401
That’s why I still recognize you

00:50:06.401 --> 00:50:08.067
every time I see you.

00:50:09.868 --> 00:50:12.902
You’re being silly. Bottom’s up.

00:50:14.301 --> 00:50:16.434
I should visit you.

00:50:22.101 --> 00:50:28.535
Was it hard to kill him, even with your gun?

00:50:29.701 --> 00:50:33.635
Sorry. I’ll get it done.

00:50:33.635 --> 00:50:36.001
No.

00:50:36.001 --> 00:50:38.868
He’s a tough one to deal with.

00:50:41.635 --> 00:50:44.201
Take care of Ogyeong, first.

00:50:45.268 --> 00:50:46.668
I also heard that

00:50:46.668 --> 00:50:50.835
Hyeonam was writing a book.

00:50:52.034 --> 00:50:56.434
I think he finished it before he died.

00:50:58.001 --> 00:50:59.934
I want you to find it.

00:51:00.668 --> 00:51:01.701
Yes, sir.

00:51:13.967 --> 00:51:15.101
(Hyeonam) Take it.

00:51:19.934 --> 00:51:21.334
This is...

00:51:21.334 --> 00:51:25.668
I finished it. I want you to read it.

00:51:25.668 --> 00:51:27.735
Is it okay for me to read it

00:51:27.735 --> 00:51:28.868
before anybody else?

00:51:28.868 --> 00:51:30.434
It’s okay.

00:51:30.434 --> 00:51:31.967
When you’re done,

00:51:31.967 --> 00:51:35.168
pass it on to Master Ogyeong.

00:51:35.168 --> 00:51:36.868
I think it’s best

00:51:36.868 --> 00:51:39.701
for Master Ogyeong to keep it.

00:51:39.701 --> 00:51:42.568
He’s going to serve His Majesty.

00:51:43.668 --> 00:51:46.034
Sir, what are you talking about?

00:51:47.234 --> 00:51:50.835
Are you planning to go to that gathering?

00:51:53.301 --> 00:51:55.101
It’s dangerous.

00:51:55.101 --> 00:51:57.301
Two of your friends have already...

00:51:57.301 --> 00:51:59.034
Don’t worry.

00:51:59.034 --> 00:52:01.301
I don’t think they’ll find out

00:52:01.301 --> 00:52:03.434
where the gathering is being held, this time.

00:52:03.434 --> 00:52:04.368
But...

00:52:04.368 --> 00:52:07.601
If anything happens to me,

00:52:07.601 --> 00:52:10.668
I’ve already finished the book.

00:52:12.134 --> 00:52:14.468
I have pupils like you.

00:52:36.067 --> 00:52:37.434
Please come again.

00:52:37.434 --> 00:52:39.201
We’ll see you around.

00:52:40.301 --> 00:52:42.134
You’re drunk all the time,

00:52:42.134 --> 00:52:44.701
so how come you haven’t been fired, yet?

00:52:44.701 --> 00:52:50.735
I guess people think that I have bad breath.

00:52:50.735 --> 00:52:54.934
If I were your boss, you’d be in jail.

00:52:54.934 --> 00:52:56.535
If I have access to alcohol and women,

00:52:56.535 --> 00:52:59.201
I can go anywhere.

00:52:59.201 --> 00:53:01.868
You always have something to say.

00:53:01.868 --> 00:53:02.334
Stop!

00:53:02.334 --> 00:53:03.368
I’m Officer Han Jeonghun

00:53:03.368 --> 00:53:04.134
from the Police Bureau.

00:53:04.134 --> 00:53:06.434
You’re unbelievable!

00:53:06.434 --> 00:53:08.434
It’s late. Go home.

00:53:08.434 --> 00:53:09.735
Okay. I’ll see you around.

00:53:09.735 --> 00:53:11.535
Okay. Bye.

00:53:37.835 --> 00:53:40.034
Darn it.

00:53:41.701 --> 00:53:44.134
I guess it’s too early.

00:54:39.401 --> 00:54:40.468
Sir.

00:54:43.501 --> 00:54:45.967
Sir, we found Master Ogyeong.

00:54:45.967 --> 00:54:46.934
Are you sure?

00:54:46.934 --> 00:54:49.434
Soldiers who were patrolling the Angol Area

00:54:49.434 --> 00:54:50.802
saw Master Ogyeong.

00:54:50.802 --> 00:54:51.902
What’s the situation now?

00:54:51.902 --> 00:54:53.301
One soldier is with him,

00:54:53.301 --> 00:54:55.201
and the other came and reported to me.

00:54:55.201 --> 00:54:57.768
That was a silly thing to do.

00:54:57.768 --> 00:55:00.501
One soldier can’t protect him.

00:55:02.067 --> 00:55:03.835
I’ll go.

00:55:03.835 --> 00:55:05.501
Follow me with more soldiers.

00:55:05.501 --> 00:55:06.434
Yes, sir.

00:55:57.768 --> 00:56:00.434
I’ve been looking for you.

00:56:00.434 --> 00:56:02.134
Where’s that bastard?

00:56:02.967 --> 00:56:04.234
What are you talking about?

00:56:05.101 --> 00:56:07.067
The gunman?

00:56:07.067 --> 00:56:09.768
I said I didn’t know him.

00:56:22.535 --> 00:56:24.768
Move. It’s not what you think.

00:56:24.768 --> 00:56:27.334
What about that gun?

00:56:28.101 --> 00:56:29.434
This is just...

00:56:31.868 --> 00:56:33.067
Put your gun down

00:56:33.067 --> 00:56:35.434
and come with me to the Police Bureau.

00:56:35.434 --> 00:56:36.635
If you do that, I might spare your life.

00:56:36.635 --> 00:56:38.868
I have nothing to do with him.

00:56:38.868 --> 00:56:40.301
If you’re innocent, come with me.

00:56:40.301 --> 00:56:41.501
Why can’t you?

00:56:43.434 --> 00:56:46.967
I have my own reasons.

00:56:46.967 --> 00:56:50.001
I’ll count to three. One!

00:56:52.635 --> 00:56:55.535
Don’t. Stay out of it.

00:56:55.535 --> 00:56:57.201
It’s dangerous.

00:56:59.601 --> 00:57:00.701
Two!

00:57:07.835 --> 00:57:10.334
Don’t do anything stupid!

00:57:10.334 --> 00:57:13.768
This is a gun. A mere sword can’t beat it.

00:57:13.768 --> 00:57:15.501
A mere sword?

00:57:23.134 --> 00:57:24.535
Here I come.

00:57:24.535 --> 00:57:26.067
Stop.

00:57:49.768 --> 00:57:52.967
(Gunman in Joseon)

00:57:52.967 --> 00:57:54.401
With a bamboo hat or

00:57:54.401 --> 00:57:55.768
with ribbons in your pigtail,

00:57:55.768 --> 00:57:56.802
you’re the same person.

00:57:56.802 --> 00:57:58.601
I don’t care what you think.

00:58:00.301 --> 00:58:00.967
How dare she?

00:58:00.967 --> 00:58:04.001
Do you hate me that much?

00:58:04.001 --> 00:58:05.168
Don’t touch me.

00:58:05.168 --> 00:58:07.268
It’s getting late.

00:58:07.268 --> 00:58:08.668
Get your hands off of me.

00:58:08.668 --> 00:58:09.802
Hold it tight.

00:58:09.802 --> 00:58:11.101
Park Yungang!

00:58:11.101 --> 00:58:13.967
How dare he treat me like that?

00:58:13.967 --> 00:58:16.434
What are you going to do from now on?

00:58:16.434 --> 00:58:18.034
I’ll take care of him myself.

00:58:18.034 --> 00:58:19.234
It’s a gun.

00:58:22.501 --> 00:58:27.101
A book can change the world.
