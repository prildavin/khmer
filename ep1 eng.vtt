WEBVTT

01:05.273 --> 01:08.234
This is the third retest.
Is that correct, Mr. Kim Min-gyu?

01:09.444 --> 01:10.570
MILITARY MANPOWER ADMINISTRATION

01:10.653 --> 01:11.821
Remove your hat and mask.

01:12.947 --> 01:16.117
Don't make me repeat.
Remove your hat and mask.

01:23.958 --> 01:26.252
"Seriously allergic to human contact."

01:26.336 --> 01:29.380
That's interesting.
Does such kind of allergy exist?

01:29.464 --> 01:31.382
The name of the disease
isn't written on the diagnosis.

01:31.466 --> 01:33.843
As a dermatologist,
I've never heard of it.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.638
I've seen mental illness as an excuse
to avoid getting drafted,

01:36.721 --> 01:37.972
but this is new.

01:38.056 --> 01:40.767
Mr. Kim, do you not want
to serve in the military?

01:40.850 --> 01:42.852
Don't you take Korean military seriously?

01:43.228 --> 01:45.730
Don't you feel bad for others who serve?

01:45.814 --> 01:47.899
Kim Min-gyu. Enlisted.

01:48.191 --> 01:49.984
What are you doing?

01:52.403 --> 01:54.155
Why are you taking off your jacket?

01:54.239 --> 01:56.074
Are you intimidating us?

01:56.199 --> 01:57.200
Go back to your seat.

01:58.368 --> 01:59.661
Go back to your seat.

01:59.994 --> 02:01.496
-What?
-Go back to your seat now.

02:01.746 --> 02:03.748
I have an intimidating upper body, too.

02:04.666 --> 02:06.000
Go back to your seat now.

02:29.107 --> 02:30.483
Is it...

02:32.694 --> 02:34.362
possible for me to enlist

02:35.655 --> 02:36.990
in the marines?

02:37.073 --> 02:38.741
I don't think so.

02:41.119 --> 02:45.206
This only appears when I'm having
physical contact with a human.

02:46.457 --> 02:47.458
The symptom...

02:48.710 --> 02:51.254
gets worse the longer the contact.

02:51.337 --> 02:54.591
It can't be prevented.

02:55.091 --> 02:56.384
Symptoms can be relieved

02:57.010 --> 02:59.053
with a shot of medication.

03:00.305 --> 03:01.973
-My goodness.
-Why did you do that?

03:02.056 --> 03:03.933
Goodness!

03:08.813 --> 03:10.064
Of course,

03:10.607 --> 03:12.525
it's not contagious.

03:13.735 --> 03:15.820
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.113
Do you have any questions?

03:27.874 --> 03:29.459
Sir.

03:29.542 --> 03:31.377
It's ready.

03:53.191 --> 03:56.152
It's already been a year
since you came to me.

03:56.778 --> 04:00.156
With such a small body, you were always...

04:00.657 --> 04:02.659
so devoted to me.

04:03.660 --> 04:06.579
You're an honest
and thoughtful bride of mine.

04:07.205 --> 04:09.332
Happy birthday, Pretty.

04:12.627 --> 04:13.628
All right.

04:15.922 --> 04:17.423
Here's your birthday present.

04:17.799 --> 04:21.261
Renew the battery
and stay with me for a long time.

04:21.552 --> 04:22.804
You're so cute.

05:02.844 --> 05:06.306
Unlike what you think,
I'm fine being alone.

05:12.979 --> 05:16.441
If the world comes to an end
and only one person can survive...

05:19.068 --> 05:21.070
that would be me.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.322
Come on.

05:22.905 --> 05:25.408
With a million sets of skills
to live by myself.

05:34.625 --> 05:37.545
People need distance between each other.

05:41.966 --> 05:42.800
I need

05:43.760 --> 05:44.719
some space...

05:47.972 --> 05:49.015
to protect...

05:52.769 --> 05:53.936
myself.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.017
I will save you your seat.

06:33.101 --> 06:34.310
You can go to the bathroom.

06:34.393 --> 06:37.021
Really? Thank you.

06:43.486 --> 06:45.196
President Cho got me this treasure.

06:45.279 --> 06:47.532
Do you see this product? The packaging...

06:47.615 --> 06:49.117
-didn't get ruined at all.
-My gosh.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.452
-I'm so popular.
-Wonder Woman of substitute purchase.

06:51.536 --> 06:53.704
Everyone, I'm so overwhelmed

06:53.788 --> 06:57.500
by all your endless gratitude.

06:57.583 --> 07:00.962
Excuse me, what's this line for?

07:01.045 --> 07:02.463
Oh, this line?

07:02.547 --> 07:04.132
WORLDWIDE RELEASE
OF LIMITED EDITION FIGURES

07:04.215 --> 07:06.634
Besiegement for a treasure.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.262
Call me if you need
a substitute purchaser.

07:09.345 --> 07:10.972
With an accumulated know-how
of many years,

07:11.055 --> 07:15.101
I'll be able to get you
any kind of limited edition products.

07:15.184 --> 07:17.687
Oh, you're the famous President Cho.

07:17.770 --> 07:20.189
I'm surprised to see how young you are.

07:20.273 --> 07:23.734
My goodness. Hello, everyone.
You all must be cold.

07:24.360 --> 07:25.236
Hey.

07:25.862 --> 07:28.823
I've tried out a lot of businesses

07:28.906 --> 07:30.366
and I've failed a lot of them.

07:30.450 --> 07:33.077
So all I have left with me

07:33.161 --> 07:36.289
is my debt
and this short temper of mine, kid.

07:36.372 --> 07:37.790
Oh, I see.

07:37.874 --> 07:41.836
But why are you suddenly
talking to me like I'm your friend?

07:41.919 --> 07:43.254
I don't get it.

07:44.422 --> 07:46.591
My gosh, you're unbelievable.

07:47.383 --> 07:50.928
You are a brainless jerk
who has no conscience.

07:51.012 --> 07:53.931
You think people sit here waiting
because they're stupid?

07:54.015 --> 07:55.308
I never looked down on anyone.

07:55.391 --> 07:57.310
How dare you cut in line?

07:57.393 --> 07:59.187
Get lost in three seconds,

07:59.270 --> 08:01.731
before I make a toothbrush
with your nasal hair.

08:01.814 --> 08:03.608
-Nice!
-Incredible!

08:03.691 --> 08:05.818
I don't have any nasal hair sticking out!

08:05.902 --> 08:07.278
And I never cut in line!

08:07.361 --> 08:09.614
I'm not even interested
in these limited edition figures.

08:09.697 --> 08:11.866
-Get lost!
-I'm not interested in this!

08:11.949 --> 08:13.868
-Go away.
-Get lost.

08:13.951 --> 08:16.746
-Leave.
-Do you know who I am?

08:16.829 --> 08:18.039
Did something happen?

08:18.122 --> 08:20.291
No, it's nothing. You can sit back down.

08:22.418 --> 08:23.711
It was a long wait, wasn't it?

08:23.794 --> 08:24.962
-Yes.
-Yes.

08:25.046 --> 08:27.840
You can enter now.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.343
Please keep your order

08:30.426 --> 08:33.846
and slowly enter the event hall
in an orderly fashion.

08:33.930 --> 08:35.014
You may come in.

08:35.097 --> 08:36.891
Thank you. Welcome.

08:37.266 --> 08:40.353
Move! It's mine! I'm going to have it!

08:40.436 --> 08:41.646
-My gosh.
-Move.

08:41.729 --> 08:44.232
Gosh, who said Korea
was a developed country?

08:44.941 --> 08:47.276
-Get out of my way!
-Move!

08:47.360 --> 08:49.195
-Stop pushing!
-Move it!

08:49.278 --> 08:51.697
-Get out of my way!
-Move!

08:51.781 --> 08:53.574
-Please calm down!
-Push!

08:53.658 --> 08:55.409
-Stop!
-Keep going!

09:47.503 --> 09:50.214
-My gosh.
-Get out of my way.

09:50.298 --> 09:52.174
-Go get that!
-Hurry!

10:11.694 --> 10:15.323
Hello. I successfully got it for you.
Where should we meet?

10:41.015 --> 10:42.058
Put it in the back seat.

10:43.351 --> 10:45.394
What? Was that a speaker?

10:45.478 --> 10:48.481
Didn't you hear me?
I told you to put it in the back seat.

10:48.564 --> 10:51.192
My gosh, I can't do that.

10:51.275 --> 10:54.612
Cash for undamaged goods.
My balance, please.

10:54.695 --> 10:56.280
I paid for the figure in advance.

10:56.364 --> 10:58.949
And your commission doubles
for direct dealing.

10:59.033 --> 11:00.409
However, in one condition.

11:00.701 --> 11:03.871
The packaging needs to be
in a perfect state.

11:03.954 --> 11:06.832
That means I need to check
the packaging first.

11:06.916 --> 11:09.335
Why can't you trust me?

11:09.794 --> 11:12.755
Fine. I'm confident
about my products anyway.

11:23.140 --> 11:24.600
My gosh.

11:29.980 --> 11:30.981
No.

11:31.982 --> 11:34.735
No!

11:36.862 --> 11:40.199
Sir, I would like my commission now.
Doubled 300,000 won.

11:40.282 --> 11:41.617
I stayed up all night for it.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.537
-I can't give it to you.
-What?

11:44.620 --> 11:46.664
There's already a stain on the box.

11:46.747 --> 11:48.457
I can never get this figure again.

11:48.999 --> 11:51.293
This means you failed
to fulfill our contract.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.547
But still, you ask me for money?

11:58.092 --> 12:00.511
That box was completely fine
when I had it.

12:00.594 --> 12:03.973
It seems like that stain suddenly appeared
as soon as you took it.

12:04.056 --> 12:05.975
My sincere apologies for what happened.

12:06.183 --> 12:08.394
Is that crap what you want to hear?

12:08.727 --> 12:10.438
How dare you try to scam me?

12:10.521 --> 12:12.731
You are the one who tried to scam me.

12:12.815 --> 12:16.235
I can forgive mistakes,
but I can't forgive people lying to me.

12:16.318 --> 12:18.237
My gosh, I can't believe this.

12:18.320 --> 12:20.448
Hey, get out of the car.

12:22.283 --> 12:23.826
Did you just lock the door?

12:24.326 --> 12:25.703
Back seat door, too?

12:26.120 --> 12:28.831
You dare try to run away
without paying me?

12:30.082 --> 12:33.836
I refuse to give a single penny
to a con artist.

12:33.919 --> 12:35.921
Hey, you're messing
with the wrong person here.

12:36.005 --> 12:37.006
Hey, get out of your car.

12:37.089 --> 12:40.509
Hey, open the door.
Get out of your car, asshole!

12:40.593 --> 12:42.845
I'll write a review,
so repent on what you did.

12:42.928 --> 12:44.430
And let's never meet each other again.

12:44.763 --> 12:46.348
You piece of trash.

12:47.141 --> 12:50.269
Hey, where do you think you're going?
Hey, stop!

12:50.352 --> 12:51.437
Hey!

12:54.482 --> 12:56.692
What? What was that sound?

13:08.621 --> 13:09.663
Did I run over her?

13:09.997 --> 13:10.915
Really?

13:11.707 --> 13:14.793
No, that can't be.

13:15.377 --> 13:17.796
My gosh, this is crazy.

13:44.865 --> 13:45.699
Hey.

13:49.286 --> 13:51.038
President Cho. Hey.

13:55.834 --> 13:56.752
Hey.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.591
My goodness.

14:11.058 --> 14:12.810
You are so handsome.

14:17.606 --> 14:19.733
Hey, where do you think you're going?

14:19.817 --> 14:22.653
Go away!

14:23.195 --> 14:25.781
Hey, let go of me. I said, let go of me!

14:26.198 --> 14:27.032
Hey!

14:27.116 --> 14:30.119
-I'm going to kill you.
-Let go of me!

14:30.202 --> 14:32.037
-Stop touching me!
-Hey!

14:32.121 --> 14:33.789
Please get away from me!

14:38.836 --> 14:39.962
Hey!

14:40.462 --> 14:46.093
I once even got hit by lumber,
just so I could get my money.

14:46.510 --> 14:48.888
Do you think this is going
to make me give up?

14:48.971 --> 14:52.224
Give me my money!
Give me my money, you jerk!

14:52.308 --> 14:54.518
Give me my money, you punk!

15:01.442 --> 15:03.944
Hey! Stop right there!

15:41.357 --> 15:43.025
Hello, Doctor Oh.

15:44.318 --> 15:47.529
It occurred at the Military Manpower
Administration and then today?

15:48.656 --> 15:50.199
You should've been careful.

15:50.699 --> 15:52.660
Take a careful look at the rash.

15:53.452 --> 15:55.829
Isn't this shaped differently?

15:55.913 --> 15:57.706
It's the same as always.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.625
No, look carefully.

15:59.708 --> 16:01.502
They were always circular,

16:01.585 --> 16:03.963
but now, this one is slightly oval.

16:04.088 --> 16:08.342
This could be a clue
to learn about my disease.

16:08.425 --> 16:10.636
That's a half-baked pimple.

16:13.597 --> 16:17.393
I had a cold sweat earlier.
Why don't you take a sample?

16:17.476 --> 16:20.980
I will if you want,
but the result will still be the same.

16:21.313 --> 16:23.774
Why won't you put
your heart and soul into this?

16:23.857 --> 16:25.442
I'm a patient.

16:25.526 --> 16:30.906
As my doctor, you should feel sorry
and cling to tiny clues like this.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.367
I did more than enough
of that for 15 years.

16:33.742 --> 16:36.412
Your illness has not yet been diagnosed.

16:36.495 --> 16:38.998
I'm sorry, but it's time you admit

16:39.081 --> 16:41.542
that the only thing you can do
is live secluded from people.

16:41.625 --> 16:42.793
Any new drugs?

16:43.293 --> 16:45.170
None. We tried almost everything.

16:45.963 --> 16:48.465
I found you a smart medical device.

16:51.510 --> 16:54.054
It was developed in Sweden,
and is being beta-tested.

16:54.138 --> 16:56.348
It measures your heart rate
and temperature,

16:56.432 --> 16:57.975
and shows your condition in colors.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.477
It's usually blue.
Yellow, when you're over 100

17:00.561 --> 17:02.771
with the early-stage rash
and breathing difficulty.

17:02.855 --> 17:06.066
Orange means you're over 1,000
with full-body rashes and closed airways.

17:06.442 --> 17:08.485
Over 2,000, it turns red.

17:08.777 --> 17:10.779
-A few minutes later--
-I die of shock?

17:12.156 --> 17:13.866
I've never gone over 2,000.

17:14.158 --> 17:15.784
You never know.

17:18.954 --> 17:20.706
What's the point of wearing this?

17:21.040 --> 17:23.959
I can't date anyone or get married.

17:24.501 --> 17:27.337
I'll live like a monster
for the rest of my life anyway.

17:27.421 --> 17:31.050
Still, might there not be just one woman
who will still like you?

17:34.970 --> 17:36.305
If there is...

17:38.807 --> 17:41.518
she wouldn't be normal either.

17:42.478 --> 17:45.189
That nasty jerk of a thief.

17:47.483 --> 17:50.194
You're done sleeping peacefully
for the rest of your life.

17:51.653 --> 17:55.949
My grudges will curse you
and you'll have nightmares every night.

17:57.159 --> 18:01.371
I will not stop
even if you plead with the deities.

18:12.424 --> 18:13.592
What's that?

18:21.141 --> 18:23.102
To the Left. Left.

18:23.185 --> 18:25.229
-Will you be quiet?
-To the right. Right.

18:25.312 --> 18:26.563
I don't have a signal.

18:26.647 --> 18:28.649
What kind of house is this big?

18:28.732 --> 18:31.235
-Where do I land?
-Find an open window.

18:31.318 --> 18:32.986
-Go, go.
-I don't see one.

18:33.070 --> 18:34.404
There's one.

18:34.488 --> 18:36.698
Yes, yes, get the right angle.

18:42.996 --> 18:44.081
What was that?

18:47.042 --> 18:49.294
Who was that?

18:49.878 --> 18:51.588
-He got it.
-He got it!

18:51.672 --> 18:53.549
-He got it!
-Let's get out of here.

18:53.632 --> 18:54.633
He got it.

18:59.263 --> 19:00.389
What's this?

19:02.391 --> 19:04.518
DAEYANG SHIPBUILDING
SANTA MARIA

19:04.601 --> 19:06.186
"Daeyang Shipbuilding"?

19:06.979 --> 19:10.107
That's the company I took over
and am trying to sell right now.

19:18.699 --> 19:21.076
Aji 3 is playing squash.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.619
It has a superior mind

19:22.703 --> 19:25.122
that can trace moving objects
and calculate trajectories.

19:25.205 --> 19:28.542
It is also able to react fast enough
to hit the moving ball.

19:28.625 --> 19:30.711
-Doctor, isn't it too dark?
-Squash?

19:30.794 --> 19:32.004
-Open the curtains.
-So what?

19:32.087 --> 19:33.172
Okay.

19:37.050 --> 19:38.177
Are you okay, Doctor?

19:38.969 --> 19:40.095
What's wrong?

19:43.807 --> 19:46.476
-Are you okay, master?
-Yes, I'm fine.

19:47.060 --> 19:49.479
-Can you keep filming?
-What?

19:50.105 --> 19:51.106
I am filming.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.191
It's a robot?

19:52.274 --> 19:53.275
Go right in.

19:56.612 --> 19:58.530
Hello, Director. Kim Min-gyu.

19:58.864 --> 20:01.491
I'm Doctor Hong Baek-gyun.

20:02.743 --> 20:04.036
Does he know me?

20:04.369 --> 20:08.790
I invite you to the demonstration
of Aji 3, an android robot,

20:08.874 --> 20:10.250
that will shock the world.

20:10.834 --> 20:11.835
Why?

20:12.794 --> 20:14.087
ROBOTICS RESEARCH CONTRACT

20:14.171 --> 20:15.923
According to this contract,

20:16.006 --> 20:19.426
you are the new owner of Aji 3.

20:19.885 --> 20:23.513
Please come and give us
the yet unpaid 50 billion won

20:23.597 --> 20:27.351
out of the 100 billion won
that we were promised.

20:27.684 --> 20:31.188
In three seconds,
this flash drive will explode...

20:32.731 --> 20:34.733
or not.

20:35.692 --> 20:36.860
Were you surprised?

20:37.527 --> 20:39.947
If you see Aji 3 in person,

20:40.030 --> 20:43.075
you will be much more shocked than that.

20:43.533 --> 20:46.370
Aji 3, the android robot
that will shock the world

20:46.453 --> 20:49.665
awaits her new owner.

20:49.748 --> 20:50.749
Goodbye.

20:56.129 --> 20:57.130
I am...

20:59.132 --> 21:00.634
that robot's...

21:01.843 --> 21:03.136
new owner?

SANTA MARIA RESEARCH

22:12.789 --> 22:14.041
My goodness.

22:31.516 --> 22:34.311
My goodness. That was scary.

22:52.704 --> 22:53.955
What's that doing?

23:20.107 --> 23:21.149
What is this?

23:23.193 --> 23:24.486
I mean...

23:25.112 --> 23:27.280
I told you already,
I don't need anything else.

23:27.364 --> 23:28.782
Get rid of all the people.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.201
I just want to see Aji 3.

23:33.829 --> 23:34.871
What?

23:36.581 --> 23:39.501
I should follow this thing?

23:52.097 --> 23:54.349
What is going on?

24:59.873 --> 25:02.042
My heart.

25:09.925 --> 25:11.551
Gosh.

25:22.145 --> 25:23.647
What is this?

25:31.029 --> 25:31.988
Hello?

25:34.658 --> 25:36.785
Is anyone here?

25:38.245 --> 25:40.163
Are you Director Kim Min-gyu?

25:59.182 --> 26:00.267
Gosh.

26:15.365 --> 26:16.574
NO INFORMATION

26:17.409 --> 26:19.286
No information is available.

26:19.828 --> 26:21.913
Are you Director Kim Min-gyu?

26:22.789 --> 26:25.834
How do you know who I am?

26:26.293 --> 26:28.545
Nice to meet you. Let's shake hands.

26:31.548 --> 26:33.967
Don't come near me. Stay away.

26:34.384 --> 26:35.635
Get away from me.

26:36.761 --> 26:39.556
Get away from me now. Goodness.

26:40.140 --> 26:43.059
Is there anyone around?

26:43.143 --> 26:45.812
-What's the matter with him?
-Is there anyone?

26:45.895 --> 26:47.147
Darn it.

26:47.230 --> 26:49.441
I heard they call him Mr. Baton.

26:49.524 --> 26:51.568
Now I see why.

26:52.110 --> 26:53.278
Goodness.

26:54.154 --> 26:55.739
Do you not want to shake hands?

26:57.198 --> 26:59.951
I'm sorry. I'll be careful from now on.

27:01.494 --> 27:03.788
I said no human beings!

27:04.122 --> 27:05.874
Do I look human?

27:06.499 --> 27:08.793
Dr. Hong said that

27:08.877 --> 27:11.338
the more you think I'm human,
the better I'm doing.

27:11.671 --> 27:12.672
Thank you.

27:13.131 --> 27:15.342
However, I'm not human.

27:16.634 --> 27:18.261
What?

27:18.345 --> 27:20.680
I'm Aji 3, an android robot

27:20.764 --> 27:23.099
made by Dr. Hong Baek-gyun.

27:25.310 --> 27:26.728
Aji 3?

27:28.521 --> 27:29.522
Are you a robot?

27:29.898 --> 27:30.857
That's right.

27:31.524 --> 27:35.487
Dr. Hong said that you would like me.

27:36.029 --> 27:38.073
Do you like me?

27:42.160 --> 27:43.703
You're trying to trick me.

27:44.120 --> 27:46.706
You're pretending to be a robot.

27:46.790 --> 27:48.917
Don't you think I know the difference?

27:52.253 --> 27:54.381
Hey, what are you doing?

27:54.464 --> 27:57.675
I'll make you believe that I'm a robot.

28:00.804 --> 28:02.013
Hey, wait.

28:47.892 --> 28:48.852
You are...

28:49.519 --> 28:51.104
really a robot.

29:17.130 --> 29:18.673
E.T.?

29:23.553 --> 29:25.096
What is he doing?

29:35.231 --> 29:37.358
She is exactly like a human...

29:38.109 --> 29:39.402
but nothing happened.

29:41.154 --> 29:42.363
Is it because she's a robot?

29:42.447 --> 29:45.408
I run automatically on battery
placed in my chest.

29:45.492 --> 29:47.660
I run for three hours
after I'm fully charged.

29:47.744 --> 29:50.121
My structure is similar to human joints.

29:50.538 --> 29:53.208
Each of my arms holds 30 kg of weight.

29:53.291 --> 29:56.085
I can detect various smells
with the NFC sensor.

29:56.169 --> 29:58.338
I can recognize objects
with a sense of touch.

29:58.838 --> 30:00.548
I have 20 functions

30:00.632 --> 30:02.967
including understanding stocks,
accounting, and foreign languages.

30:03.051 --> 30:04.636
Please use me as you please.

30:21.820 --> 30:25.490
I didn't get extra funding,
so I couldn't pay the electricity bills.

30:25.573 --> 30:28.618
I use electricity from a nearby factory,
but it went bankrupt today.

30:29.285 --> 30:31.412
I heard you are a crook in science.

30:31.496 --> 30:34.040
I heard you are a delinquent in finance.

30:38.044 --> 30:40.797
Is there anything else I should know?

30:40.880 --> 30:42.590
About our Santa Maria Team--

30:42.674 --> 30:44.008
I'm talking about Aji 3.

30:46.553 --> 30:47.428
Of course.

30:47.846 --> 30:48.805
Aji 3.

30:50.348 --> 30:51.933
How do I feel right now?

30:55.728 --> 30:57.313
You're angry.

30:59.148 --> 31:00.191
I'm sorry.

31:00.483 --> 31:02.694
Did I do something wrong, Doctor?

31:03.736 --> 31:05.905
No, I'm not angry.

31:07.574 --> 31:09.993
I'm happy that you aren't angry.

31:10.076 --> 31:13.288
This is Aji 3's main skill.

31:13.746 --> 31:16.082
Aji 3 went through deep learning,

31:16.165 --> 31:18.042
an essential process for an AI.

31:18.126 --> 31:21.504
She can read facial expressions
and feel emotions.

31:21.880 --> 31:22.797
I guarantee it.

31:23.089 --> 31:26.551
Soon, we'll live in a time
where we train robots.

31:27.302 --> 31:28.344
Train robots?

31:29.345 --> 31:31.931
Is it like training dogs?

31:33.474 --> 31:36.311
Sir, do you want to hear a joke?

31:37.020 --> 31:37.854
What?

31:37.979 --> 31:40.857
Do you know who killed Captain Crunch?

31:42.817 --> 31:43.818
A cereal killer.

31:51.659 --> 31:52.869
You just laughed.

31:53.244 --> 31:54.913
My sense of humor has defeated you.

31:56.372 --> 31:59.167
Is this her main skill

31:59.542 --> 32:01.961
that you were talking about?

32:03.546 --> 32:07.425
One person needs to give Aji 3
more than a month of deep learning.

32:07.508 --> 32:10.303
She must accumulate
enough information to understand--

32:10.386 --> 32:11.346
Tomorrow...

32:12.096 --> 32:15.350
I'll check if her skills work.

32:15.558 --> 32:18.144
We'll discuss
the additional funding later.

32:19.479 --> 32:21.272
Send Aji 3 to my house tomorrow,

32:22.732 --> 32:24.567
so I can test her out.

32:37.830 --> 32:39.374
Please sit down.

32:41.334 --> 32:43.419
Are you prepared for the contract?

32:43.503 --> 32:44.504
-Yes.
-Yes.

32:45.088 --> 32:46.756
This is the last time.

32:47.548 --> 32:50.218
Let's hit a home run in one go.

32:50.510 --> 32:51.803
-Yes, CEO.
-Yes, CEO.

32:55.890 --> 32:56.933
Hello, sir.

32:57.684 --> 32:59.936
I'll join the meeting now. Get ready.`

33:00.019 --> 33:00.895
Pardon?

33:01.145 --> 33:02.605
Hello?

33:07.360 --> 33:08.444
Security Manager?

33:09.070 --> 33:10.613
Director Kim is on his way.

33:11.239 --> 33:13.324
Right now? Yes, sir.

33:13.950 --> 33:14.951
Emergency!

33:15.076 --> 33:16.536
-Emergency.
-Emergency.

33:16.619 --> 33:17.662
He's coming.

33:18.329 --> 33:20.748
Come this way now!

33:21.416 --> 33:23.292
Hurry up, everyone!

33:23.876 --> 33:25.878
Faster. Move quickly!

33:26.421 --> 33:29.382
Emergency alert. Director Kim is arriving.

33:29.966 --> 33:31.843
Director Kim is arriving.

34:18.097 --> 34:20.183
Reduce the salary of that employee.

34:37.033 --> 34:39.744
Please continue without stopping.

34:50.213 --> 34:53.007
In two days, we will sign an agreement
to sell the R&amp;D Team

34:53.091 --> 34:55.384
to the Bold Group from the UK.

34:56.010 --> 34:59.972
That will happen, as planned,
in the main conference room.

35:00.264 --> 35:01.891
This deal will conclude

35:01.974 --> 35:05.394
the division and sale
of Daeyang Shipbuilding.

35:07.021 --> 35:08.439
Thank you.

35:16.197 --> 35:17.698
Yes, Director?

35:17.782 --> 35:20.451
There's something I don't know much about.

35:21.369 --> 35:25.248
What does Daeyang Shipbuilding's
R&amp;D Team research?

35:25.748 --> 35:30.294
I believe they research
technology to build ships.

35:31.003 --> 35:35.341
I invite you to the demonstration
of Aji 3, an android robot,

35:35.424 --> 35:37.093
that will shock the world.

35:39.303 --> 35:40.304
I see.

35:41.055 --> 35:43.641
There is something I really don't know.

35:44.642 --> 35:45.935
The Santa Maria team.

35:47.145 --> 35:48.771
What are their accomplishments?

35:49.313 --> 35:52.483
I don't believe
they have anything noteworthy.

36:01.367 --> 36:02.577
You should better...

36:04.412 --> 36:05.830
take responsibility for that.

36:06.455 --> 36:07.456
Pardon?

36:12.128 --> 36:15.173
You are hanging in there.
You must be tough.

36:15.256 --> 36:17.842
-What? Who--
-Don't you know me?

36:17.925 --> 36:19.302
I head the Social Contribution Team.

36:19.385 --> 36:22.013
I've been the brain of the company
for 20 years.

36:22.096 --> 36:24.849
I apologize.
I've only worked here for a month.

36:24.932 --> 36:27.393
You work directly with Mr. Baton.

36:27.810 --> 36:29.687
I mean, Director Kim. It must be hard.

36:29.770 --> 36:32.148
No one can stand him for over a month.

36:32.565 --> 36:36.068
I think you are our 25th hire.

36:36.152 --> 36:37.320
Twenty-fifth?

36:38.738 --> 36:40.948
If you want to switch loyalties,
come to me.

36:41.032 --> 36:42.825
I will act as a go-between.

36:42.909 --> 36:44.243
What do you mean?

36:44.327 --> 36:46.746
Don't you know
of the company's two rivals?

36:46.829 --> 36:49.540
CEO Hwang Yu-cheol and Mr. Baton.

36:50.249 --> 36:54.337
Why? CEO Hwang and Mr. Baton
are friends and rivals.

36:59.550 --> 37:01.052
You're acting out of character.

37:03.095 --> 37:07.099
Acting out of character is my specialty.
You know that.

37:07.183 --> 37:09.769
I'm in charge
of selling Daeyang Shipbuilding.

37:09.852 --> 37:11.896
-You're messing up the chain of--
-You.

37:12.480 --> 37:15.024
You are the chairman. And me?

37:15.399 --> 37:17.068
I'm head of the board of directors.

37:17.818 --> 37:19.528
I keep the company going,

37:19.612 --> 37:22.573
and I earn 70 percent
of KM Financial's profits.

37:23.241 --> 37:26.953
Is there still a problem
with this chain of command?

37:27.787 --> 37:28.955
Fine.

37:29.956 --> 37:32.124
-If you want to say--
-Not right now.

37:32.208 --> 37:35.127
I might have something to say later.

37:35.211 --> 37:37.922
Until then, keep doing what you are doing.

37:38.005 --> 37:39.048
Whatever it is.

37:39.715 --> 37:40.758
Goodbye.

37:52.603 --> 37:54.730
EMAIL TO MADAM X

37:56.607 --> 37:58.901
REQUESTING X-FILES FOR DAEYANG
SHIPBUILDING'S LATE CHAIRMAN PARK

38:07.159 --> 38:09.745
It worked!

38:10.496 --> 38:12.456
Why isn't this one lighting up?

38:12.999 --> 38:14.542
Ta-da. It's on.

38:14.625 --> 38:17.670
That's not what I asked for.

38:18.004 --> 38:19.839
How many times must I explain?

38:19.922 --> 38:22.383
If you're that frustrated,
make it yourself.

38:22.466 --> 38:25.261
Come on, Mr. Genius.

38:25.594 --> 38:27.221
-Look at this.
-At what?

38:29.348 --> 38:33.561
See, someone touches this light
with their hands.

38:33.644 --> 38:35.438
As soon as someone does that,

38:35.521 --> 38:38.024
the other light has to light up.

38:38.107 --> 38:39.900
Whether it's in Korea or Africa,

38:39.984 --> 38:42.611
if there's Wi-Fi,
they both have to light up.

38:42.695 --> 38:44.155
That's the whole point.

38:44.238 --> 38:47.575
Will this actually be mass-produced?

38:47.658 --> 38:49.994
Competitions are hard to enter,

38:50.077 --> 38:51.871
and I, President Cho,

38:51.954 --> 38:54.790
managed to reach
the final stage with my idea.

38:55.082 --> 38:58.336
If my prototype and presentation
get me first place,

38:58.419 --> 39:01.714
one hundred million won
will end up in my account.

39:02.298 --> 39:04.258
Farewell, part-time jobs.

39:04.383 --> 39:05.801
Greetings, President Cho.

39:10.348 --> 39:11.265
Cheers.

39:13.893 --> 39:17.396
I knew we had no budget
because the company was failing,

39:17.480 --> 39:20.816
but who knew that huge company
would get sold off?

39:20.900 --> 39:23.319
We're siphoning electricity from next door

39:23.402 --> 39:26.322
and have no money to pay the rent.

39:27.114 --> 39:28.741
There's always a way out.

39:28.824 --> 39:30.451
The new company's really rich.

39:30.534 --> 39:33.579
They'll give us 50 billion won
without a problem, right?

39:33.662 --> 39:36.749
When the money comes in, let's move.

39:38.959 --> 39:40.586
We must change her battery.

39:41.128 --> 39:42.630
And sensors and parts.

39:42.713 --> 39:43.756
Change everything.

39:44.006 --> 39:45.383
A new vat for new wine.

39:45.466 --> 39:48.469
A new robot for a new facility.

39:49.512 --> 39:50.721
I brought more beers.

39:52.640 --> 39:53.891
Aji 3.

39:54.016 --> 39:56.185
What pick comes whenever we eat meat?

39:56.268 --> 39:58.229
-A toothpick.
-A toothpick.

39:59.063 --> 40:00.147
Right?

40:00.523 --> 40:02.233
Stop teaching her weird things.

40:02.316 --> 40:03.859
That's why she's weird.

40:03.943 --> 40:06.695
No one makes her laugh as much as I do.

40:06.779 --> 40:08.447
Shall we bet? 10,000 won?

40:08.531 --> 40:09.740
Are you in? I'm in.

40:09.824 --> 40:11.325
-I'm in.
-Yes.

40:12.284 --> 40:14.370
Aji 3, when we get more funding,

40:14.453 --> 40:16.247
I will give you silicone breasts.

40:17.456 --> 40:19.458
I do not know what that means.

40:19.542 --> 40:21.043
-You're out.
-Aji 3.

40:21.127 --> 40:24.046
What happens when your cheekbones jump
into the air?

40:24.130 --> 40:26.132
Cheekbones can't jump into the air.

40:26.215 --> 40:27.341
They aren't dragons.

40:27.425 --> 40:28.426
-You're out.
-You're out.

40:33.556 --> 40:34.682
That's cheating.

40:34.765 --> 40:36.100
-That's unfair.
-I could say that.

40:36.183 --> 40:37.935
But you didn't. Pay up.

40:50.948 --> 40:56.328
So that's where Aji 3
and Mr. Baton's memories will be saved?

40:58.497 --> 41:00.249
Go away, will you?

41:00.332 --> 41:01.959
Don't you see her chest is open?

41:02.042 --> 41:04.795
Just one drop of fluid
will short her circuits and fry her!

41:05.129 --> 41:06.380
Hey.

41:07.173 --> 41:08.299
Hey.

41:15.973 --> 41:18.100
Can you throw this away for me?

41:21.645 --> 41:23.063
Thank you.

42:09.568 --> 42:10.945
I'm home.

42:14.907 --> 42:16.992
Why are you both standing there?

42:17.701 --> 42:19.662
Dad's home, Auntie.

42:21.622 --> 42:24.542
Your brother found out. Sorry.

42:28.587 --> 42:32.758
Jin-bae, will you let me explain first?

42:32.841 --> 42:34.969
-Come over here.
-Jin-bae.

42:35.052 --> 42:38.681
Didn't I say I will kick you out
if you start another business?

42:38.764 --> 42:40.975
Didn't I tell you to get a job?

42:41.058 --> 42:42.935
Jin-bae.

42:43.018 --> 42:45.563
I was going to get a job.

42:45.646 --> 42:46.897
I just can't.

42:46.981 --> 42:49.984
Then you should improve yourself,
and find a way,

42:50.067 --> 42:51.860
not think you're an entrepreneur.

42:51.944 --> 42:55.781
How dare you borrow from my wife
as much as ten million won?

42:56.448 --> 42:57.992
What did you spend that on?

42:58.075 --> 42:59.702
What trash did you make this time?

42:59.785 --> 43:01.078
I'm really sorry.

43:01.161 --> 43:03.831
Stop running around. You have weak lungs.

43:03.914 --> 43:04.915
When will you grow up?

43:04.999 --> 43:08.168
I get what you mean.
Shall we talk after dinner?

43:08.252 --> 43:11.714
It's your birthday today.
I bought your favorite cake.

43:13.173 --> 43:14.425
Did I ask you to?

43:22.933 --> 43:24.101
Can't you...

43:26.478 --> 43:28.647
Can't you just cheer me on?

43:29.023 --> 43:32.610
Dad supported you,
and you studied to your heart's content.

43:32.693 --> 43:34.612
You went to a good university
and became a lawyer.

43:34.695 --> 43:37.072
You got married, had Dong-hyeon,
and accomplished everything.

43:37.156 --> 43:39.950
Who cares about my degree and my job?

43:40.034 --> 43:41.452
Do you think my life is great?

43:41.535 --> 43:43.162
It's so incredibly great.

43:44.079 --> 43:46.081
Can't you let me off?

43:46.707 --> 43:49.835
Now that Dad's gone,
I only have you to lean on.

43:49.918 --> 43:52.671
Forget it. Quit everything you were doing.

43:52.755 --> 43:54.632
I won't ask you to pay any bills.

43:54.715 --> 43:57.718
Don't sleep during the day.
Take a class or find a job.

43:57.801 --> 43:59.219
Don't take the easy way out.

43:59.303 --> 44:01.430
Do you think this is easy?

44:01.513 --> 44:03.223
It is just as hard as finding a job.

44:03.307 --> 44:04.642
Why do I sleep during the day?

44:04.725 --> 44:07.186
I stayed up last night
and the night before.

44:07.269 --> 44:08.604
To pay you back.

44:08.687 --> 44:09.980
Then pay us back.

44:10.064 --> 44:12.066
Go to the bank and pay us back.

44:12.149 --> 44:14.610
I will. I said I will!

44:18.656 --> 44:20.741
-I am Korean...
-Sta. Maria Research...

44:23.952 --> 44:25.913
Hoktal, did you find one?

44:25.996 --> 44:28.290
There is nothing. I'm really sorry.
I should just die.

44:28.374 --> 44:29.875
If you can talk, make another call.

44:29.958 --> 44:32.670
-Ssanip, anything?
-No.

44:32.753 --> 44:34.421
Thank you.

44:34.838 --> 44:35.839
I found one.

44:36.382 --> 44:37.841
There was one left in C Lab.

44:40.219 --> 44:43.263
But it's coming from abroad
and will arrive in two days.

44:44.890 --> 44:47.434
Will Mr. Baton give us
a two-day extension?

44:49.061 --> 44:50.062
We must ask.

44:51.021 --> 44:52.773
-Pai, you call him.
-Me?

44:52.856 --> 44:54.358
It would be better coming from a woman.

44:55.609 --> 44:58.278
Do I seem like a woman to you?

44:58.654 --> 44:59.613
I'll call him.

45:03.367 --> 45:04.910
-What is it?
-Director.

45:05.327 --> 45:09.123
I would like you to give me
two more days to test out Aji 3.

45:09.498 --> 45:11.750
I didn't tell you something earlier.

45:12.709 --> 45:15.754
Daeyang Shipbuilding's R&amp;D Team
including Santa Maria

45:15.838 --> 45:19.216
will be sold to the UK's Bold Group
in two days' time.

45:19.800 --> 45:22.386
We only have tomorrow to test her out.

45:27.850 --> 45:29.852
BOLD GROUP, JOHN MARTIN

45:33.856 --> 45:35.566
A patent hunter?

45:37.734 --> 45:40.279
He will split Aji 3 up and sell her parts.

46:10.851 --> 46:12.352
I'll pay you back.

46:13.061 --> 46:16.190
I'll take a loan to pay you back.

46:19.485 --> 46:20.611
Who is this?

46:23.030 --> 46:25.491
I don't need a loan.

46:33.040 --> 46:35.542
My credit rating has hit rock bottom.

46:35.626 --> 46:37.419
I don't need a loan!

46:37.503 --> 46:40.255
If you want to give me money,
give me ten million won!

46:42.466 --> 46:44.343
It's been a while.

46:45.010 --> 46:46.220
Who is this?

46:46.970 --> 46:47.930
It's me.

46:48.680 --> 46:50.057
Have you forgotten my voice?

46:50.557 --> 46:53.143
I have a terrible memory.

46:53.227 --> 46:54.811
Who are you?

46:54.895 --> 46:56.813
Were we close? You're too chummy.

46:58.482 --> 46:59.650
It's Hong Baek-gyun.

46:59.733 --> 47:01.944
What? Hong and Baek?

47:02.444 --> 47:03.904
Don't pretend that you don't remember me.

47:04.154 --> 47:05.489
It's me, Fungus.

47:06.949 --> 47:10.369
If you have fungus,
bleach is what you need.

47:14.081 --> 47:16.083
I'll give you ten million won.
Where are you?

47:21.588 --> 47:25.384
What kind of name is Fungus?

47:25.467 --> 47:28.554
Is Fun his first name and Gus his surname?

47:35.227 --> 47:36.144
Was it...

47:37.771 --> 47:39.273
that Fungus?

47:44.611 --> 47:48.156
How could you forget about him, you idiot?

47:49.783 --> 47:52.327
I can't meet him looking like this.

48:13.640 --> 48:15.851
It's been a long time.

48:15.934 --> 48:19.354
Your hair! Why... How?

48:19.438 --> 48:20.939
When did you cut it?

48:21.023 --> 48:23.567
Why did you cut your hair?

48:24.067 --> 48:27.279
Your breasts! How padded is your bra?

48:27.779 --> 48:31.325
Okay. So, you can wear a wig

48:31.408 --> 48:34.119
and wear bras without any padding.

48:37.247 --> 48:41.418
When most people meet again
after a long while,

48:41.918 --> 48:44.254
they usually ask how the other person
has been doing.

48:44.338 --> 48:45.547
Yes, right.

48:45.881 --> 48:49.843
It looks like you haven't
been doing too well.

48:50.135 --> 48:51.928
So I'm glad.

48:54.681 --> 48:58.477
Your face is more wrinkly. I'm glad too.

48:59.186 --> 49:00.062
What?

49:00.812 --> 49:02.439
Why do you still...

49:03.315 --> 49:04.483
care so much?

49:04.941 --> 49:08.570
You don't listen to me,
so that hasn't changed.

49:08.945 --> 49:10.030
We broke up,

49:10.113 --> 49:13.617
so listen carefully
to what I have to say, Professor.

49:14.076 --> 49:17.079
When most people hear a comment like that,

49:17.162 --> 49:20.540
they focus on the phrase
about wrinkles, but you,

49:21.416 --> 49:24.878
you just focus on the word "you."

49:24.961 --> 49:27.005
Your brain is structured

49:27.089 --> 49:31.009
so that you can only listen
to the words you want to hear.

49:31.093 --> 49:33.970
You need to fix that. That's...

49:36.264 --> 49:37.933
That's really mean.

49:38.392 --> 49:39.726
It's because I'm a genius.

49:41.269 --> 49:43.855
Why are you here, Mr. Genius?

49:43.939 --> 49:46.650
-To help you pay back your debt.
-My debt?

49:46.733 --> 49:48.360
You must feel bad for what you did.

49:48.443 --> 49:50.654
I'll give you a chance
to make it up to me.

49:54.700 --> 49:55.701
Ten million won.

49:56.535 --> 49:59.121
Take the money and work part-time for me.

49:59.204 --> 50:00.706
For just three hours tomorrow.

50:00.789 --> 50:01.665
Ten million won?

50:03.375 --> 50:05.711
Are you going to sell my organs?

50:06.837 --> 50:08.797
It's something only you can do.

50:09.047 --> 50:10.757
That's what the money is for.

50:11.091 --> 50:12.467
Just one day for three hours.

50:12.551 --> 50:15.137
What kind of job is it?

50:15.721 --> 50:20.684
If Active Sound were to go in...
just a moment.

50:20.767 --> 50:22.811
If this goes in there,

50:22.894 --> 50:24.563
the decision sequence...

50:43.081 --> 50:44.374
Are you finally awake, Aji?

50:45.000 --> 50:46.293
Did you fix her?

50:46.752 --> 50:48.754
How did you fix her without the parts?

50:49.546 --> 50:52.674
Our team really is the best.

50:53.216 --> 50:55.343
You're wearing a different wig.

50:56.887 --> 51:00.348
Why are your breasts so big?
Did the battery puff up?

51:00.724 --> 51:01.725
Don't worry.

51:02.601 --> 51:03.935
I'll fix you.

51:08.940 --> 51:10.442
Say hello.

51:11.401 --> 51:13.945
This is Cho Ji-a, Aji 3's model.

51:14.696 --> 51:16.990
Model? She's a human being?

51:17.282 --> 51:18.325
Oh, dear.

51:18.658 --> 51:19.743
I'm sorry,

51:20.535 --> 51:23.121
but how do you know each other?

51:25.165 --> 51:28.627
Once upon a time,
we knew each other for a while.

51:28.710 --> 51:29.628
Wait.

51:30.045 --> 51:30.921
Wait.

51:31.463 --> 51:33.507
What's this about a model?

51:51.399 --> 51:52.442
Why...

51:53.568 --> 51:55.111
Why am I over there?

51:57.072 --> 51:59.366
Has your ex lost his mind?

51:59.449 --> 52:02.452
The scientist who made a robot
with his ex's face.

52:02.536 --> 52:04.037
How good a likeness was it?

52:04.371 --> 52:05.539
Did it look human?

52:05.622 --> 52:07.541
Like something from an SF movie?

52:07.624 --> 52:09.751
-Is this funny?
-I'm worried.

52:09.835 --> 52:13.088
Breakups follow something
called the "Law of Lunacy."

52:13.171 --> 52:15.590
The lunacy you didn't release
during the breakup

52:15.674 --> 52:18.510
is bound to come out one day.

52:18.593 --> 52:20.929
I think this is his lunacy coming out.

52:21.012 --> 52:22.305
What lunacy is that?

52:22.389 --> 52:24.057
He still has feelings for you.

52:24.140 --> 52:26.351
Are you trying
to make me hopeful or scared?

52:26.434 --> 52:27.561
Which is it?

52:30.105 --> 52:32.357
-Shall we flip a coin?
-You're a goner.

52:32.440 --> 52:35.193
I think you aren't over him either.

52:35.277 --> 52:37.779
Get back together with him. Take the job.

52:37.863 --> 52:39.447
So that you can get over him.

52:40.866 --> 52:42.617
No, I won't see him.

52:42.701 --> 52:45.287
I would rather get thrown out of my house

52:45.370 --> 52:46.788
than take that crazy job.

52:47.664 --> 52:49.749
You are sisters-in-law now, not friends.

52:49.833 --> 52:51.459
Why did you get her a loan?

52:51.835 --> 52:54.671
She's still like that
because you keep babying her.

52:54.963 --> 52:59.467
Okay, I get what you mean.
Can't we let her come home?

52:59.551 --> 53:01.177
No way.

53:01.261 --> 53:04.222
She can't come home
until she pays us back ten million won.

53:08.226 --> 53:09.394
My back hurts.

53:10.395 --> 53:13.815
I should bill him for medical expenses.

53:14.357 --> 53:16.776
That evil scumbag of a thief.

53:27.454 --> 53:28.371
My necklace.

53:37.672 --> 53:38.798
The ten million won.

53:39.591 --> 53:43.511
I think you owe me that much
for giving your robot my face.

53:43.929 --> 53:47.265
I'll do the job for you for free.

53:47.349 --> 53:49.768
That is shamelessly illogical.

53:50.268 --> 53:52.270
But the result is the same, so deal.

53:52.354 --> 53:54.940
I hope that me doing this doesn't give you

53:55.023 --> 53:57.817
the idea that I still have
feelings for you.

53:57.901 --> 54:00.779
I also hope that you
don't think I asked you

54:00.862 --> 54:02.489
because I have feelings for you.

54:04.658 --> 54:05.700
What should I do?

54:05.992 --> 54:07.786
Where did it go?

54:07.869 --> 54:09.996
Did it fall on the floor?

54:11.706 --> 54:13.750
This is insane. Where...

54:17.754 --> 54:18.630
Hey.

54:19.506 --> 54:22.717
Give me my money!
Give me my money, you jerk!

54:22.968 --> 54:24.260
Give me my money!

54:27.180 --> 54:29.641
That crazy President Cho!

54:30.976 --> 54:31.810
NASTY JERK

54:31.893 --> 54:35.397
Robots from previous generations
had clunky movements.

54:36.356 --> 54:39.734
They moved like this.
Beetle, keep still. Look at me.

54:39.818 --> 54:42.988
These days, state of the art robots
move like humans.

54:43.071 --> 54:45.156
They move effortlessly in fluid motions.

54:45.240 --> 54:48.284
Very smoothly like a human.

54:48.368 --> 54:52.038
To look sideways,
turn your head first and then your body.

54:52.122 --> 54:54.541
Walk smoothly. Do you understand?

54:54.624 --> 54:57.585
-Yes.
-It's easy, right? Be smooth.

54:57.669 --> 54:58.795
Hey, stay still.

55:04.426 --> 55:06.177
Are you trying
to do the traditional masked dance?

55:06.261 --> 55:07.887
-This is what you did.
-Are you being serious?

55:07.971 --> 55:09.431
Did I really do that? Dr. Hong--

55:09.514 --> 55:11.516
-Let's try it again.
-Okay.

55:11.599 --> 55:16.062
First generation robots
used to put down objects like this.

55:16.146 --> 55:17.814
Then they would just let go of it
irresponsibly.

55:17.897 --> 55:20.483
But Aji 3 was different.
She would be very careful.

55:20.567 --> 55:22.277
She would put it down slowly like this,

55:22.360 --> 55:24.404
and she would make sure
not to make a sound.

55:24.487 --> 55:26.573
You should give it a try. Go on.

55:27.282 --> 55:28.491
You just made a sound.

55:35.874 --> 55:36.916
That's right.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.044
You need to put this on.

56:03.985 --> 56:05.653
What is this? Is this all?

56:06.488 --> 56:09.991
I thought there would be something more
since I had to act like a robot.

56:22.087 --> 56:25.006
That contact lens
is a subminiature camera.

56:25.423 --> 56:27.467
And this is a wireless transmitter.

56:28.843 --> 56:29.928
Wear it on your wrist.

56:30.011 --> 56:31.679
Hoktal, connect it with our network.

56:33.973 --> 56:35.016
All done, sir.

56:40.438 --> 56:43.358
-Incredible.
-You're connected to Aji 3 now.

56:43.817 --> 56:47.654
To make it easier to understand,
you're Aji 3's avatar.

56:47.737 --> 56:51.533
Aji 3 will be seeing and hearing
everything you see and hear.

56:51.616 --> 56:53.076
Then the display will show you

56:53.159 --> 56:55.578
what you need to do in text or video.

56:55.829 --> 56:57.831
You just need to follow the instructions.

57:00.458 --> 57:03.378
I love you, master. How may I help you?

57:03.461 --> 57:05.046
I LOVE YOU, MASTER. HOW MAY I HELP YOU?

57:05.421 --> 57:06.381
"I..."

57:09.926 --> 57:11.761
Are you seriously asking me to say that?

57:12.637 --> 57:16.015
Did you make me-looking robot say,
"I love you" to you every day?

57:16.391 --> 57:17.934
Do you still have feelings for me?

57:18.685 --> 57:20.061
What? "Feelings"?

57:21.563 --> 57:23.189
What are you talking about?

57:24.816 --> 57:26.484
I told you not to misunderstand.

57:26.568 --> 57:28.194
Aji 3 is different from you.

57:28.278 --> 57:31.030
She has everything you lack.
She's perfect.

57:31.114 --> 57:32.782
Superior to you in every way.

57:32.866 --> 57:35.535
Did you just say she's more perfect
and smarter than me?

57:35.869 --> 57:37.203
In what ways?

57:37.287 --> 57:40.415
She's just a robot.
She is no different from a doll.

57:40.498 --> 57:43.418
Aji 3, analyze the stock market in Europe.

57:48.423 --> 57:49.382
Wow.

57:50.008 --> 57:53.636
Aji 3, read the most recent article
that got published on The Science.

57:53.720 --> 57:54.846
Read the original text.

57:59.017 --> 58:01.561
My gosh, this is incredible.

58:02.061 --> 58:03.771
I feel like a genius.

58:03.855 --> 58:05.523
You have an IQ level of 94.

58:05.607 --> 58:08.568
However, Aji 3's IQ level is immeasurable.
She's the genius.

58:08.651 --> 58:11.321
But how am I supposed to read this?
I can't speak English.

58:15.492 --> 58:20.121
DAEYANG SHIPBUILDING
SANTA MARIA

58:27.045 --> 58:28.463
My gosh, what should we do?

58:28.546 --> 58:31.049
Get out of the car and look for a bell.

58:31.132 --> 58:33.635
-It's opening!
-My goodness.

58:33.718 --> 58:34.886
My gosh.

58:35.470 --> 58:36.429
We're here.

58:38.556 --> 58:39.474
NASTY JERK

58:41.100 --> 58:42.852
What do you want, nasty jerk?

58:44.354 --> 58:46.272
You finally picked up your phone.

58:46.356 --> 58:48.191
I was a little busy.

58:48.733 --> 58:51.736
Did you finally decide to pay me?
Fine by me.

58:51.819 --> 58:54.948
You took my necklace, didn't you?

58:55.532 --> 58:56.407
What?

58:56.908 --> 58:59.369
Why are you blaming me
for something that you lost?

58:59.452 --> 59:02.288
You grabbed my necklace
and snatched it from my neck.

59:02.372 --> 59:04.624
-Can't you remember?
-This is ridiculous.

59:04.707 --> 59:08.836
You better give me back my necklace
before I actually sue you.

59:08.920 --> 59:10.964
Hey, are you sick?

59:11.047 --> 59:12.549
I'm being serious right now.

59:12.632 --> 59:13.800
-Go see a doctor.
-What?

59:13.883 --> 59:16.135
Mental Illness is not to be ashamed of.

59:16.219 --> 59:17.887
Go see a doctor for your own good.

59:18.638 --> 59:20.348
How dare you try me?

59:20.431 --> 59:21.975
NASTY JERK
156 MISSED CALLS, 45 TEXT MESSAGES

59:22.809 --> 59:25.895
He left me 156 missed calls
and 45 text messages.

59:32.610 --> 59:34.946
-She's going in.
-She's going in right now.

59:40.868 --> 59:43.079
My gosh, what a nice house.

59:45.081 --> 59:47.166
This place feels like LA.

59:47.250 --> 59:50.837
-I have a friend named Jane in LA.
-My gosh.

59:50.920 --> 59:51.838
Is this a house?

59:51.921 --> 59:54.716
Her red hair is really pretty.

59:56.884 --> 59:59.679
My gosh, this place is like LA.
It reminds me of Jane.

59:59.762 --> 1:00:01.556
-Turn off your cell phone.
-It's not mine.

1:00:01.681 --> 1:00:03.891
-Turn it off, please.
-My gosh.

1:00:04.517 --> 1:00:07.645
-Ji-a, turn off your phone.
-She brought her cell phone?

1:00:07.729 --> 1:00:10.356
-Is she crazy? Turn it off.
-Ji-a, please turn off your phone.

1:00:10.440 --> 1:00:11.858
My gosh.

1:00:11.941 --> 1:00:13.026
Please turn it off.

1:00:13.109 --> 1:00:15.695
You call me one more time,
I'll call the police.

1:00:15.778 --> 1:00:17.322
-That's what I should be saying.
-Please--

1:00:17.405 --> 1:00:19.282
If you don't give me back my necklace,

1:00:19.365 --> 1:00:21.284
I'm going to chase you until...

1:00:23.369 --> 1:00:25.455
My gosh, that crazy woman.

1:00:25.830 --> 1:00:28.374
My gosh, that nasty jerk.

1:00:33.630 --> 1:00:35.048
Here you go.

1:00:46.059 --> 1:00:47.894
A glass of water would've been great.

1:01:14.462 --> 1:01:16.881
I love you, master. How...

1:01:17.840 --> 1:01:20.802
My goodness!
