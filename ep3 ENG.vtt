WEBVTT

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:46.012
It wasn't me! I didn't kill her!

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:47.580
I have been accused!

00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:49.049
It wasn't me!

00:00:49.182 --> 00:00:50.917
Even if you continue to insist on denial,

00:00:50.984 --> 00:00:52.485
The fingerprints we found prove otherwise.

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:54.020
Oh Mi Suk was killed.

00:00:54.154 --> 00:00:57.123
Do not call me or send messages to my personal email address.

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:16.709
My father?

00:01:16.776 --> 00:01:18.878
Give it back to me later, okay?

00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:20.313
Promise me.

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:28.588
Did he die?

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:30.223
-Are you okay? -Are you okay?

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.061
What does he do?

00:01:48.508 --> 00:01:50.510
Are you going to do a blood test or not?

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:55.949
Did you raise the child alone?

00:01:58.251 --> 00:01:59.419
How...

00:02:01.588 --> 00:02:02.889
I told you...

00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:05.859
I told you that...

00:02:05.925 --> 00:02:08.795
You should have waited in front of the operating room like a real gangster.

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:13.766
What about your parents? What about moving outside the country?

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:16.369
I thought you traveled with your parents.

00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:20.140
Tae San, I'm not here to make small talk with you.

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:24.144
Are you going to do a blood test or not?

00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:25.712
That's all I need to know.

00:02:27.447 --> 00:02:30.650
If you're going to have a blood test, come to this place...

00:02:31.618 --> 00:02:32.585
"Yule University Hospital"

00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:33.686
At 4 tomorrow.

00:02:35.054 --> 00:02:36.489
If you don't want that...

00:02:48.134 --> 00:02:49.202
Call this number.

00:02:53.473 --> 00:02:56.409
If I didn't want to do it?

00:02:57.744 --> 00:02:59.212
Yes, if you didn't want her to live.

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:12.959
If

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:17.630
I didn't want her to live?

00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:57.670
Detective Lim, ignore it.

00:03:57.971 --> 00:03:59.038
Don't think about it.

00:03:59.172 --> 00:04:02.108
How can he forget? He was unable to wipe his buttocks after using the bathroom.

00:04:02.508 --> 00:04:04.410
Sir, are there no paper towels in the bathroom?

00:04:07.714 --> 00:04:09.716
Do you think I'm in the mood to joke?

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.987
What did you just say?

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:16.789
- Not in the mood to joke? - No, sir.

00:04:16.856 --> 00:04:19.859
He wasn't talking to you. He was talking to me, sir.

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:22.161
I'm not the only one who wanted him to confess.

00:04:22.562 --> 00:04:24.697
Stop acting like you're the only investigator here.

00:04:24.831 --> 00:04:27.500
Stop. You know he's a perfectionist.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.901
I'm sorry sir.

00:04:29.335 --> 00:04:31.738
I mean, homicide detectives

00:04:31.804 --> 00:04:33.640
They are not just tracking dogs that catch the suspect.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.377
I'm upset because that rude idiot left without saying anything.

00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:39.245
Then why don't you ask your father?

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:42.515
Are you trying to brag because your father is the General Commissioner?

00:04:44.717 --> 00:04:46.386
Sir, do not mention personal matters at work.

00:04:46.452 --> 00:04:47.920
You despicable people!

00:04:48.054 --> 00:04:50.690
Have I become invisible in your eyes because I will retire soon?

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:53.359
Don't stop exchanging words.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.162
Go out and solve it with your fists.

00:04:57.864 --> 00:04:59.532
Who killed Oh Min Suk?

00:05:01.834 --> 00:05:03.469
- Where is the killer? - Who are you?

00:05:04.771 --> 00:05:06.105
This is Jin L Doe from the Homicide Unit.

00:05:06.172 --> 00:05:07.173
Me

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:11.044
Park Jae-gyeong from the South Sector Prosecutor's Office in Seoul.

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:12.178
Really?

00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:15.081
He was sent there a while ago.

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:18.184
Did you send it already?

00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:20.620
Do you know the murdered woman?

00:05:22.722 --> 00:05:24.190
Sergeant Yang!

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.526
The investigation team called to tell us that Tae San had escaped.

00:05:26.926 --> 00:05:28.328
He ran away? To where?

00:05:28.795 --> 00:05:31.364
- “Jang Tae San”? - 20 minutes ago.

00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:33.266
A car accident occurred at the intersection of the "Mok" neighborhood.

00:05:33.433 --> 00:05:35.034
He escaped during the chaos.

00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:36.936
How can he escape after a car accident?

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:38.671
He is in handcuffs. What does the follow-up team do?

00:05:38.738 --> 00:05:41.107
Motorcycle. He found a motorcycle.

00:05:41.474 --> 00:05:45.044
Sergeant Yang, the Chief wants you in his office.

00:05:45.411 --> 00:05:47.313
Oh my God, this is crazy.

00:05:48.214 --> 00:05:50.083
Check out the surveillance camera clips!

00:05:52.218 --> 00:05:53.586
What did you just say?

00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:56.756
"Jang Tae San"?

00:05:57.657 --> 00:06:00.827
Jang Tae San is the suspect in Oh Mi Suk's murder?

00:06:01.594 --> 00:06:02.695
It wasn't him!

00:06:03.162 --> 00:06:06.632
He wasn't the one who stabbed my father!

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.301
It's that man over there!

00:06:09.202 --> 00:06:12.271
I have seen him.

00:06:15.475 --> 00:06:16.642
Listen...

00:06:36.496 --> 00:06:37.630
How are things going?

00:06:42.468 --> 00:06:43.536
Keep me updated.

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:44.971
Yes, this is the follow-up room.

00:06:45.438 --> 00:06:46.539
No.

00:06:46.739 --> 00:06:47.940
No, we haven't found anything yet.

00:06:51.477 --> 00:06:52.612
I think we found it.

00:06:53.546 --> 00:06:55.915
Turn left at the intersection of "Moli" station and "Moli" district.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.886
Jang Tae San left Seobu Expressway 5 minutes ago.

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:02.422
He is heading towards the "Moli" station intersection in "Moli" district.

00:07:02.488 --> 00:07:04.157
Will he return to this place?

00:07:04.757 --> 00:07:06.459
- And the handcuffs? - He is still shackled to her.

00:07:07.794 --> 00:07:09.729
He comes back to remove the handcuffs.

00:07:10.596 --> 00:07:11.631
Okay.

00:07:12.131 --> 00:07:14.634
He passed through the intersection with the “Mouli” neighborhood 5 minutes ago.

00:07:15.001 --> 00:07:16.769
He must have passed from here and there.

00:07:18.604 --> 00:07:20.606
Yeouido Complex, Gangbyon Road and Olympic Expressway,

00:07:20.773 --> 00:07:23.075
And the "Seobu" Expressway, which leads to the "Mok" neighborhood.

00:07:23.142 --> 00:07:25.111
Start the inspection and look for the bike.

00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:28.848
He will try to remove the handcuffs, so check his house and hardware stores.

00:07:28.915 --> 00:07:30.550
All factories equipped with cutting machines.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:31.884
Check all taxi drivers.

00:07:32.685 --> 00:07:34.754
If he were here, he would be like a mouse in a trap.

00:07:34.887 --> 00:07:37.323
Block every path and search for him. And the bike...

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:38.524
Find the bike first.

00:07:38.991 --> 00:07:41.961
-Do you see that? -It's a motorcycle.

00:07:42.028 --> 00:07:43.696
- The key is here. -You are right.

00:08:07.453 --> 00:08:09.222
- Watch the store. - Yes, sir.

00:08:45.091 --> 00:08:47.760
What are you talking about?

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:51.464
Mi Suk is like a sister to me.

00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:52.632
Do you say?

00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:56.035
Mi Seok, the girl you considered a sister, was killed.

00:08:56.402 --> 00:08:59.238
The suspect who was arrested at the crime scene fled.

00:08:59.438 --> 00:09:01.707
So you want me to let you be in charge of finding him?

00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:04.310
-Is that what you're saying? -I want to catch the criminal.

00:09:05.144 --> 00:09:06.746
Who killed Mi Seok with my own hands.

00:09:06.812 --> 00:09:08.080
“Jae Gyeong.”

00:09:08.981 --> 00:09:10.383
Am I a joke in your opinion?

00:09:10.449 --> 00:09:13.052
Do you think I am a child who will believe your fairy tale?

00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:14.854
Are you stupid?

00:09:16.022 --> 00:09:19.125
What trouble did you cause once you returned from Chicago?

00:09:20.159 --> 00:09:21.327
You better tell me the truth.

00:09:22.361 --> 00:09:23.563
If you were in my place,

00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:28.234
Would you have invited a slow and incompetent prosecutor like you?

00:09:28.301 --> 00:09:31.504
Struggling with complex cases, being responsible for the case of an escaped criminal?

00:09:32.438 --> 00:09:33.539
Get out.

00:09:37.743 --> 00:09:38.778
“Oh Mi Seok”

00:09:40.713 --> 00:09:42.448
She died because of me.

00:09:43.749 --> 00:09:45.051
What do you mean?

00:09:52.758 --> 00:09:54.627
I was conducting an investigation.

00:09:54.694 --> 00:09:55.695
What?

00:09:56.095 --> 00:09:59.865
Moon Il Seok and Cho Seo Hee started communicating in Busan.

00:10:00.032 --> 00:10:03.202
Il Seok came to Seoul in 2005, and Seo Hee joined him later.

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:04.470
After she was re-elected.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:07.340
After Il-seok came to Seoul, he listed Songsil Capital and Il-seok Construction,

00:10:07.406 --> 00:10:09.875
And "MC Global" on the stock exchange

00:10:09.976 --> 00:10:11.177
In just 8 years.

00:10:11.243 --> 00:10:13.379
He couldn't have achieved this alone.

00:10:13.579 --> 00:10:14.780
Isn't that Cho Seo Hee?

00:10:15.881 --> 00:10:19.185
The woman who became the representative for people with disabilities because of her son?

00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:22.254
She is famous for her integrity and for helping minorities.

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:25.558
She creates an image of herself to expand her relationships.

00:10:25.725 --> 00:10:27.193
Thanks to that,

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.896
Citizens voluntarily nominate her for the position of Mayor of Seoul.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:34.467
I am responsible for Oh Mi Suk's death.

00:10:34.533 --> 00:10:35.968
I was the one who recruited her.

00:10:38.437 --> 00:10:40.339
Moreover, Jang Tae San killed her.

00:10:41.273 --> 00:10:43.175
If I hadn't held it in my hands,

00:10:44.377 --> 00:10:47.046
I will not be able to live in peace.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.722
Why did you send him to the prosecutor's office so quickly?

00:10:57.156 --> 00:11:00.493
Did you check Oh Mi Sook's house carefully?

00:11:00.593 --> 00:11:03.729
We used an advanced spy detector to search her entire home.

00:11:04.263 --> 00:11:07.366
She was only informed of our meeting.

00:11:07.566 --> 00:11:10.436
- What about others? - I made sure

00:11:10.803 --> 00:11:13.172
The taxi driver who gave Jang Tae San a lift didn't say a word.

00:11:14.106 --> 00:11:16.275
If you finish cleaning up this mess,

00:11:16.976 --> 00:11:19.178
It is best to complete the case as quickly as possible.

00:11:19.578 --> 00:11:20.946
"Jang Tae San"

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.716
He was almost killed in the police station.

00:11:23.916 --> 00:11:25.685
So he won't trust the officers there.

00:11:25.751 --> 00:11:28.421
If he used his right to silence, the investigation would continue for a longer time.

00:11:28.721 --> 00:11:30.823
Then the reporters' curiosity about the case will increase.

00:11:31.023 --> 00:11:34.527
He's probably planning to tell prosecutors everything.

00:11:35.194 --> 00:11:36.529
Moon Il Seok is the criminal.

00:11:36.595 --> 00:11:37.897
This is what I'm saying.

00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:41.634
What if Park Jae-kyung got her hands on the case?

00:11:45.738 --> 00:11:48.274
I will make sure she is not responsible for the case.

00:11:49.241 --> 00:11:51.977
Your task is to choose the right public prosecutor.

00:11:59.652 --> 00:12:00.953
I understand what you mean.

00:12:02.455 --> 00:12:03.789
I understand now.

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:05.424
You are truly amazing...

00:12:05.491 --> 00:12:07.560
Sir!

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.462
Hello, Sir and Madam Representative Cho.

00:12:09.795 --> 00:12:13.132
Jang Tae San just ran away.

00:12:13.332 --> 00:12:14.633
What?

00:12:16.368 --> 00:12:17.636
- He ran away? - Yes.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:20.339
Moreover, she became "Park Jae-kyung"

00:12:20.673 --> 00:12:23.342
The prosecutor responsible for the case.

00:12:25.211 --> 00:12:29.148
They say that the winds bring what ships do not desire.

00:12:29.448 --> 00:12:32.485
And look what happened. I can't believe he escaped.

00:12:32.918 --> 00:12:35.187
I've suffered enough with Shen Changwen.

00:12:35.254 --> 00:12:36.388
Is this happening again?

00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:39.225
Why doesn't he let me retire in peace?

00:12:39.358 --> 00:12:42.027
He is in handcuffs. He won't be able to last long in this neighborhood.

00:12:42.495 --> 00:12:43.629
I'm sure we'll catch him soon.

00:12:44.029 --> 00:12:46.665
Just because he's not far away doesn't mean we'll be able to find him.

00:12:47.032 --> 00:12:49.001
The fugitives do everything they can,

00:12:49.068 --> 00:12:50.770
Unlike those who chase them.

00:12:50.836 --> 00:12:53.439
What happened? Did you call Go Man Seok?

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:56.776
He was on vacation yesterday and today, so he didn't come to work.

00:12:56.842 --> 00:12:58.744
He's not home and his phone is off.

00:12:59.078 --> 00:13:02.181
Detective Jin is monitoring Jang Tae San's house.

00:13:02.281 --> 00:13:05.384
Do you think he might have met Jang Tae San?

00:13:06.886 --> 00:13:09.655
He visited him earlier today, and we are checking the CCTV footage

00:13:09.722 --> 00:13:10.990
To make sure it was planned...

00:13:12.892 --> 00:13:14.293
I am the responsible prosecutor

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:17.062
About Jang Tae San's escape case.

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:19.231
This is investigation agent Do Sang Hoon.

00:13:20.232 --> 00:13:22.234
Are you responsible for Jang Tae San's escape case?

00:13:22.835 --> 00:13:24.503
Will the prosecutor's office handle the investigation?

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:26.939
He escaped while being transferred to us.

00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:30.176
That was fast.

00:13:30.242 --> 00:13:32.411
Please inform us of the current status of the investigation.

00:13:32.478 --> 00:13:34.046
I'm sure he's still here.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:38.417
He didn't have enough time to meet Man-seok to cut off his handcuffs.

00:13:38.984 --> 00:13:41.287
Who says Jang Tae San met Go Man Seok?

00:13:43.122 --> 00:13:46.392
If you were in his place, who would you ask for help?

00:13:46.559 --> 00:13:49.495
I wouldn't resort to Go Man Seok. He will be the first to be monitored.

00:13:49.628 --> 00:13:52.064
Fugitives from justice are always caught near their homes.

00:13:52.431 --> 00:13:54.867
They ask for help from their parents, siblings, friends and loved ones.

00:13:55.467 --> 00:13:57.102
Especially if they were handcuffed.

00:13:57.236 --> 00:13:59.738
An hour and a half had passed since he entered the “Mawli” neighborhood intersection.

00:13:59.872 --> 00:14:01.407
But you didn't find any motorcycle.

00:14:01.473 --> 00:14:04.376
He is most likely hiding in a secluded area where there are no surveillance cameras.

00:14:04.777 --> 00:14:06.946
He knows everything because he is a thug in this neighborhood.

00:14:08.447 --> 00:14:10.649
Detective Lim, I investigated Jang Tae San.

00:14:11.684 --> 00:14:15.254
Do you have clear evidence proving that he is the killer?

00:14:18.657 --> 00:14:21.727
He was arrested at the crime scene and we found his fingerprints on the knife,

00:14:21.794 --> 00:14:24.797
He was taking drugs before committing the crime, and he had no alibi.

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:32.037
I will examine the crime scene. They expanded the search to include the entire city

00:14:32.238 --> 00:14:33.873
So he couldn't leave Seoul.

00:14:40.145 --> 00:14:42.047
"Bye, Saul."

00:15:13.746 --> 00:15:14.847
I have arrived.

00:15:15.881 --> 00:15:17.616
Hello, let's come in.

00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:06.265
I'm dying to drink a glass of water now.

00:17:08.093 --> 00:17:10.629
There's nowhere to hide if they ambush me.

00:17:11.597 --> 00:17:13.766
I can hold my breath for a minute.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.201
But the inspection will not end in a minute.

00:17:31.683 --> 00:17:32.885
"Prosecution Service"

00:17:32.951 --> 00:17:34.486
- Hello. - Welcome.

00:17:34.653 --> 00:17:36.422
- Please sit down. - Okay.

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:41.226
You couldn't leave work because I suddenly asked to meet you.

00:17:41.393 --> 00:17:44.196
I apologize for making you wait.

00:17:44.997 --> 00:17:47.399
Don't worry, if she wants an important person like you

00:17:47.466 --> 00:17:50.903
Talk to me, I should wait.

00:17:51.136 --> 00:17:54.740
Women's organizations ask for a favor.

00:17:55.707 --> 00:17:58.143
Women's organizations? What do you mean?

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:01.680
I heard that the prosecutor in the case of the fugitive suspect that took place today

00:18:02.614 --> 00:18:04.817
She is a woman.

00:18:04.983 --> 00:18:06.085
Yes.

00:18:06.151 --> 00:18:07.986
Her name is Park Jae-kyung.

00:18:08.821 --> 00:18:10.823
But why do you think this is important?

00:18:13.092 --> 00:18:15.060
This may seem inappropriate,

00:18:16.328 --> 00:18:19.431
But about Park Jae-kyung...

00:18:20.799 --> 00:18:23.802
Does she lack experience?

00:18:24.837 --> 00:18:28.207
Not good at solving cases?

00:18:28.874 --> 00:18:31.310
I don't understand what you mean.

00:18:33.679 --> 00:18:35.314
An inexperienced and incompetent prosecutor

00:18:37.382 --> 00:18:39.751
Responsible for such a big issue.

00:18:40.252 --> 00:18:42.321
They worry that the case will be handled recklessly

00:18:42.721 --> 00:18:45.891
Only because the victim was working as a hostess in a bar.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:51.630
But how did women’s organizations know that the plaintiff, “Park?”

00:18:51.697 --> 00:18:53.565
Responsible for the case?

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:57.369
The victim was brutally killed.

00:19:09.381 --> 00:19:10.883
Mi Sook was very naive.

00:19:11.383 --> 00:19:13.619
Even when I learned that Moon Il Seok noticed something,

00:19:15.487 --> 00:19:17.055
She kept waiting for my call.

00:19:17.923 --> 00:19:19.791
So Jang Tae San killed her.

00:19:23.862 --> 00:19:25.531
I didn't know any of this,

00:19:26.365 --> 00:19:29.234
I wasted my time in the United States trying to find Cho Seo Hee's son.

00:19:30.335 --> 00:19:32.037
You didn't know this would happen.

00:19:33.572 --> 00:19:35.274
I misjudged the situation

00:19:35.841 --> 00:19:38.577
I thought he would easily reveal his relationship with Cho Seo Hee.

00:19:39.545 --> 00:19:41.346
Since the training institute,

00:19:42.314 --> 00:19:43.782
I spent a lot of time watching them,

00:19:44.082 --> 00:19:46.652
But I couldn't put them together.

00:19:47.653 --> 00:19:50.088
I even hired someone to track them down for 3 months.

00:19:50.355 --> 00:19:52.057
They were very secretive.

00:19:54.493 --> 00:19:56.929
You should wait here. I'll look for the camera.

00:19:57.696 --> 00:19:58.697
No.

00:20:00.532 --> 00:20:01.767
I will look for it.

00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:18.350
It doesn't exist.

00:20:32.431 --> 00:20:34.933
They must have found out about the camera.

00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:36.702
They killed Mi Seok...

00:20:39.271 --> 00:20:40.806
And they took the camera.

00:20:40.872 --> 00:20:42.107
What should we do now?

00:20:42.174 --> 00:20:43.775
We should find Jang Tae San.

00:20:44.042 --> 00:20:46.912
If we find him, we can reinvestigate Mi Seok's murder case.

00:20:47.212 --> 00:20:49.982
And start putting pressure on Moon Il Seok, at least until the auction party

00:20:52.084 --> 00:20:53.719
So we should set something on Cho Seo Hee as well.

00:20:53.952 --> 00:20:55.487
What auction party?

00:20:55.554 --> 00:20:59.291
They did not attend any party together.

00:21:00.225 --> 00:21:03.562
But this time, Moon Il Seok will attend the auction party held by Cho Seo Hee.

00:21:03.862 --> 00:21:07.099
I don't know the details yet, but I'm sure there's a reason.

00:21:09.067 --> 00:21:11.336
"Chief Prosecutor, Han."

00:21:12.638 --> 00:21:13.705
Yes sir.

00:21:13.772 --> 00:21:17.576
Prosecutor Park was removed from the investigation of the fugitive case.

00:21:19.311 --> 00:21:21.280
What do you mean?

00:21:21.346 --> 00:21:22.881
These are the orders of the Attorney General.

00:21:23.949 --> 00:21:26.652
He said that you cannot investigate the issue that the entire nation is focused on.

00:21:27.552 --> 00:21:28.654
Sir.

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:31.290
This decision is based on the capabilities you have demonstrated so far.

00:21:32.124 --> 00:21:34.860
Prosecutor Song will take over the investigation from tomorrow, so he will step down from the case.

00:21:34.926 --> 00:21:37.429
Sir!

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:40.766
He wants to remove you from the fugitive case?

00:21:40.932 --> 00:21:43.802
He told me I was incompetent. I brought this on myself.

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:49.741
The phone cannot be accessed.

00:21:51.443 --> 00:21:52.811
This cannot happen.

00:21:55.881 --> 00:21:57.983
No, it is not possible!

00:22:09.027 --> 00:22:10.796
“Thank you, Representative Cho.”

00:22:10.862 --> 00:22:12.130
"I wish you luck"

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:02.848
Wine.

00:23:04.683 --> 00:23:08.153
I thought he was going to die but he ran away?

00:23:11.056 --> 00:23:13.058
Where is that bastard?

00:23:21.633 --> 00:23:22.934
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

00:23:23.168 --> 00:23:25.504
I know there is no excuse for what happened.

00:23:26.471 --> 00:23:27.973
But I will do my best

00:23:28.373 --> 00:23:30.409
To find Jang Tae San before Park Jae Gyeong finds him.

00:23:30.475 --> 00:23:32.010
I won't make any mistakes this time.

00:23:32.277 --> 00:23:34.279
I already took care of Park Jae-kyung.

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:38.049
So Jang Tae San took over.

00:23:41.219 --> 00:23:42.421
She's amazing.

00:23:44.222 --> 00:23:47.392
She removed Park Jae-kyung from the fugitive case.

00:23:48.493 --> 00:23:52.164
You have never applied like this before.

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:54.833
She no longer has a reason to protect her reputation.

00:23:55.634 --> 00:23:56.968
Cho Seo Hee...

00:23:59.304 --> 00:24:02.174
She is using her influence since everything is about to end.

00:24:04.042 --> 00:24:07.179
I think she'll have the auction party no matter what.

00:24:08.079 --> 00:24:09.815
Tell me about “Mi Sook.”

00:24:10.515 --> 00:24:14.486
Don't you really know anything about her?

00:24:20.692 --> 00:24:23.929
Why do you keep talking about a dead woman?

00:24:24.696 --> 00:24:28.533
After you came to drink during the day?

00:24:29.434 --> 00:24:32.671
Forget about it and drink another cup.

00:24:35.841 --> 00:24:37.375
Oh Mi Suk, who they claim I killed...

00:24:37.476 --> 00:24:39.644
And Moon Il-seok, president of Songsil Capital...

00:24:39.744 --> 00:24:42.113
I want you to know the nature of their relationship.

00:24:46.551 --> 00:24:48.820
Someone told me that "Oh Mi Suk"

00:24:49.654 --> 00:24:51.389
She had a special relationship

00:24:52.023 --> 00:24:53.658
Who owns this place?

00:24:56.094 --> 00:24:57.429
Moon Il Seok, right?

00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:00.899
I heard there is something between them.

00:25:01.032 --> 00:25:04.336
I'll let you know if I order another bottle.

00:25:04.669 --> 00:25:06.471
-Agreed? - Really?

00:25:07.372 --> 00:25:08.707
Are you serious?

00:25:09.441 --> 00:25:10.742
Promise me.

00:25:11.343 --> 00:25:12.477
Make the deal.

00:25:13.445 --> 00:25:14.446
Okay.

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:17.649
Bring another bottle.

00:25:35.734 --> 00:25:38.803
Oh Mi Suk and Moon Il Seok

00:25:39.037 --> 00:25:40.171
They were in a relationship.

00:25:40.539 --> 00:25:42.307
But he killed her.

00:25:43.108 --> 00:25:45.410
Then he framed Tae San.

00:25:45.477 --> 00:25:46.878
In the murder.

00:25:49.447 --> 00:25:52.717
Tae San, I knew what happened.

00:25:56.688 --> 00:25:59.925
I wonder when I can visit him

00:26:01.092 --> 00:26:02.894
At the police station tomorrow.

00:26:03.695 --> 00:26:04.763
Mr. Go Man Seok?

00:26:10.335 --> 00:26:11.469
Pain

00:26:12.704 --> 00:26:13.905
Do you really know?

00:26:14.005 --> 00:26:15.106
Yes, I didn't know.

00:26:15.607 --> 00:26:17.142
Did Tae San really escape?

00:26:17.208 --> 00:26:18.343
Why didn't you answer our calls?

00:26:19.044 --> 00:26:20.712
Did you drink with Jang Tae San?

00:26:20.779 --> 00:26:24.583
No, I drank with my coworkers.

00:26:24.849 --> 00:26:26.818
Dae Pil and Jin Ho.

00:26:27.052 --> 00:26:28.119
You can contact them.

00:26:28.653 --> 00:26:29.955
And I turned off my phone

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:34.960
Because I didn't want Young Ja to get the wrong idea about me.

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:37.729
- Detective Jane. -Why are there so many movies?

00:26:37.862 --> 00:26:40.432
Did Jang Tae San work at a video rental store?

00:26:40.932 --> 00:26:43.435
-He loves movies. - Contact Abang Palace to verify his story.

00:26:44.069 --> 00:26:45.136
Okay sir.

00:26:47.472 --> 00:26:50.241
Who does Jang Tae San usually call and meet?

00:26:50.809 --> 00:26:54.546
He usually has no one to contact or meet.

00:26:54.646 --> 00:26:58.416
If you helped cover up a criminal

00:26:59.684 --> 00:27:00.685
You will get into big trouble.

00:27:00.752 --> 00:27:01.987
I don't lie.

00:27:02.921 --> 00:27:06.057
He rarely talks about himself.

00:27:06.124 --> 00:27:09.794
So, tell me every name you heard from him at least once.

00:27:10.095 --> 00:27:11.463
You both grew up in the same orphanage.

00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:13.598
- Write the names. - Okay.

00:27:16.835 --> 00:27:19.504
"Dae Ryung, Seok Do..."

00:27:19.571 --> 00:27:22.107
Jang Tae San hasn't met Go Man Seok?

00:27:23.241 --> 00:27:24.676
We have verified his alibi.

00:27:24.743 --> 00:27:26.811
He was upset after meeting Jang Tae San.

00:27:27.312 --> 00:27:28.880
So he went to a bar to drink alcohol.

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:30.482
I can't believe this.

00:27:30.815 --> 00:27:32.784
How dare he try to trick us like this?

00:27:33.818 --> 00:27:36.388
Sir, they found Jang Tae San's bike.

00:27:37.088 --> 00:27:39.190
Did they find her? where?

00:27:39.257 --> 00:27:41.726
Two high school students tried to sell it at a used bike store.

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:45.130
They said she was parked in front of the school with her key.

00:27:45.296 --> 00:27:47.666
He did this to mislead us.

00:27:47.732 --> 00:27:49.768
Expand your search to include the entire country!

00:27:52.137 --> 00:27:55.974
"Checkpoint"

00:27:59.444 --> 00:28:00.712
We need to inspect your truck.

00:28:00.879 --> 00:28:02.681
Can you lift the covers?

00:28:03.148 --> 00:28:04.916
This is a sand truck.

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:08.353
Completely packed with sand. No one can hide in it.

00:28:09.287 --> 00:28:10.455
I'm in a hurry.

00:28:27.839 --> 00:28:28.940
Here you go.

00:29:00.638 --> 00:29:01.940
We thank you for your cooperation with us.

00:29:02.207 --> 00:29:04.242
You work hard at your work.

00:29:06.778 --> 00:29:09.948
Why don't you unload the truck completely?

00:32:03.254 --> 00:32:05.223
Damn!

00:35:07.572 --> 00:35:09.640
What's the matter? Can't you sleep?

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:11.776
Is your arm still numb? Shall I massage it for you?

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:15.513
I can't sleep because of the noise.

00:35:15.847 --> 00:35:17.048
I will turn off the TV.

00:35:18.449 --> 00:35:19.717
I mean my heartbeat.

00:35:20.051 --> 00:35:23.287
The sound of my heartbeat is very loud.

00:35:24.322 --> 00:35:25.723
I know you are happy but you should sleep.

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:28.426
Here is the bulletin, a suspect has escaped.

00:35:28.493 --> 00:35:32.096
Jang, a murder suspect, escaped today at about 4:30

00:35:32.163 --> 00:35:35.566
When a car accident occurred while he was being transported

00:35:35.666 --> 00:35:38.236
From Yeongdeungbu Police Department to the South District Prosecutor's Office.

00:35:38.336 --> 00:35:40.872
We will hear more details from correspondent “Yom”...

00:35:41.272 --> 00:35:43.341
Yeongdeungbu Police Department?

00:35:43.774 --> 00:35:45.776
I think Mr. Lim will be very busy.

00:35:46.577 --> 00:35:48.846
What will you do now? You will get bored.

00:35:49.814 --> 00:35:52.550
I'm not a child, why do I feel bored in his absence?

00:35:55.153 --> 00:35:57.054
I wonder if the fugitive was that man.

00:35:57.588 --> 00:35:58.689
Who?

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:02.160
Mr. Lim caught an evil man.

00:36:02.226 --> 00:36:03.394
The killer.

00:36:03.895 --> 00:36:05.897
He's the guy who killed someone, right?

00:36:06.397 --> 00:36:08.799
I heard about him in the news before.

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:11.736
- “Soo Jin.” - I am also good at talking about nice things.

00:36:11.969 --> 00:36:14.639
The gentleman who will donate my bone marrow to me is a nice person.

00:36:15.473 --> 00:36:16.707
Mr?

00:36:18.242 --> 00:36:19.343
What do you mean?

00:36:19.644 --> 00:36:23.247
I thought it would be a man.

00:36:24.148 --> 00:36:25.583
He's a man, right?

00:36:26.918 --> 00:36:29.620
How many times do I have to tell you that I don't know?

00:36:34.125 --> 00:36:35.259
Hurry up and sleep.

00:36:54.345 --> 00:36:55.947
Please be here.

"National Criminal Evidence Service"

00:39:49.587 --> 00:39:51.789
Prosecutor Park, have you been here all night?

00:40:08.873 --> 00:40:10.107
“Jae Gyeong.”

00:40:13.744 --> 00:40:15.246
Get up. Let's go in.

00:40:17.181 --> 00:40:18.816
How...

00:40:21.819 --> 00:40:23.921
I will face Mi Suk? I feel so bad.

00:40:28.225 --> 00:40:30.094
The matter is out of your hands.

00:40:31.028 --> 00:40:33.397
We should wait until Jang Tae San is arrested.

00:41:10.668 --> 00:41:13.871
It started from the neck to the chest

00:41:15.105 --> 00:41:16.273
Even the abdomen.

00:41:17.174 --> 00:41:19.143
He stabbed her mercilessly.

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:22.112
Sir, if it was a spontaneous crime

00:41:22.646 --> 00:41:25.850
The direction of the stab wouldn't have been down, right?

00:41:26.016 --> 00:41:30.387
No, if the crime had not been planned, the stabs would have been directed upward.

00:41:30.554 --> 00:41:32.690
He was determined to kill her.

00:41:33.958 --> 00:41:36.694
He stabbed her until she died. Jang Tae San, that bastard.

00:41:41.031 --> 00:41:44.201
Her face looks better than it did before.

00:41:45.069 --> 00:41:46.570
What is the point?

00:41:47.438 --> 00:41:49.673
I saved her, then killed her.

00:41:50.774 --> 00:41:52.977
If she was still a drug addict...

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.582
She would still be alive.

00:42:00.084 --> 00:42:02.820
"National Criminal Evidence Service"

00:42:03.087 --> 00:42:05.956
We did not find the blood of anyone other than the victim.

00:42:17.735 --> 00:42:19.803
Why are you taking that?

00:42:21.138 --> 00:42:22.606
I should bury her

00:42:23.574 --> 00:42:25.142
With her.

00:42:33.851 --> 00:42:34.952
What's wrong?

00:42:35.319 --> 00:42:36.587
What a shame.

00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:40.958
I...

00:42:42.893 --> 00:42:44.328
I bought this for her

00:42:45.429 --> 00:42:48.933
On her birthday last year. Wow, Mi Seok.

00:42:52.336 --> 00:42:55.739
“Mi Sook.” How can you die like this?

00:43:09.787 --> 00:43:11.021
What is this?

00:43:15.993 --> 00:43:17.127
What is this?

00:43:18.128 --> 00:43:20.130
“Receipt, 50 thousand won.”

00:43:20.931 --> 00:43:22.566
It's a receipt from a pawn shop.

"digital camera"

00:43:23.968 --> 00:43:25.502
I put the digital camera there.

Digital camera?

00:43:27.504 --> 00:43:28.839
“Name: (Oh Mi Suk)”

00:43:29.206 --> 00:43:31.075
"All Ocean Pawn Shop"

00:43:35.312 --> 00:43:37.214
I don't think they took the digital camera.

“Jae Gyeong.”

00:43:44.822 --> 00:43:46.323
What is this?

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:47.524
Amidst her belongings,

00:43:48.959 --> 00:43:51.395
I found a receipt from a pawn shop for a digital camera.

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:53.897
Pawn shop receipt?

00:43:57.201 --> 00:43:58.402
It's the evidence

00:43:59.436 --> 00:44:02.773
Who Mi Seok tried to protect even during her death.

00:44:03.607 --> 00:44:06.176
The camera includes a recording of Moon Il Seok and Cho Seo Hee.

00:44:06.744 --> 00:44:08.045
And the conversation between them.

00:44:10.681 --> 00:44:13.117
Please let me catch Moon Il Seok and Cho Seo Hee, sir.

00:44:14.018 --> 00:44:15.819
If I had not had the authority to investigate,

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.889
The camera will end up in Representative Cho's hands.

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:21.925
Then Mi Seok will have died in vain.

00:44:22.159 --> 00:44:24.161
And the effort you have made over the past 8 years

00:44:24.228 --> 00:44:25.863
In my father's case, it would be useless.

00:44:25.929 --> 00:44:27.564
Your father? Are you saying...

00:44:27.631 --> 00:44:31.035
Yes. This is correct. So I worked as a prosecutor.

00:44:31.935 --> 00:44:34.571
I pretended to be incompetent in order to leave work early

00:44:34.705 --> 00:44:36.807
To focus on investigating Moon Il Seok and Cho Seo Hee.

00:44:36.874 --> 00:44:39.009
You became a prosecutor to arrest Moon Il Seok and Cho Seo Hee?

00:44:41.011 --> 00:44:42.212
I'm sorry, sir.

00:44:43.881 --> 00:44:45.983
"receipt"

00:44:51.522 --> 00:44:53.357
I will have to risk everything for this cause.

00:44:53.791 --> 00:44:55.159
Are you ready to risk everything?

00:44:59.329 --> 00:45:00.698
Anyway, if I catch them,

00:45:01.331 --> 00:45:04.268
I will resign from my job as a prosecutor since I am not qualified for this job.

00:45:04.334 --> 00:45:07.371
That's not what I'm saying. I'm talking about your life.

00:45:08.672 --> 00:45:10.240
You may die.

00:45:19.783 --> 00:45:21.885
We have not received any reports of missing cutting machines.

00:45:21.952 --> 00:45:23.887
No one reported seeing a man in handcuffs.

00:45:24.321 --> 00:45:25.522
We did not receive any report.

00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:28.325
Is he hiding in a place with a hostage or something like that?

00:45:28.525 --> 00:45:30.527
This wouldn't have happened if we hadn't moved it.

00:45:31.895 --> 00:45:34.765
Let us reinvestigate the case, sir. What should we do?

00:45:35.232 --> 00:45:37.401
Team One, go to Busan to investigate all his contacts.

00:45:37.534 --> 00:45:38.535
The second will investigate Seoul.

00:45:38.802 --> 00:45:41.772
They investigated his orphanage, his schools, and the bars and pool halls he went to

00:45:41.839 --> 00:45:43.907
While he was working with the gangs, and all the women he dated.

00:45:44.007 --> 00:45:45.609
I want information about everything.

00:45:45.676 --> 00:45:47.377
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

00:45:47.644 --> 00:45:50.514
They submitted an urgent request to extract his phone record.

00:45:50.647 --> 00:45:53.584
She told again about the gambling halls and nightclubs she frequented.

00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:54.918
What about you sir?

00:45:55.152 --> 00:45:56.720
I will join you after passing somewhere.

00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:58.122
Are you going to visit Mrs. Seo?

00:45:58.522 --> 00:46:00.991
Check if they received a call last night.

00:46:02.292 --> 00:46:03.427
Okay, ma'am.

00:46:11.301 --> 00:46:12.536
Mr. Lim.

00:46:12.703 --> 00:46:14.738
Mom, Mr. Lim came.

00:46:16.106 --> 00:46:17.374
“Seung Yoo.”

00:46:18.075 --> 00:46:20.944
I thought you would be busy with the case. How did you manage to come?

00:46:21.645 --> 00:46:24.915
You've disappointed me. How could you think I wouldn't visit her?

00:46:25.516 --> 00:46:27.518
Soo Jin, aren't you right?

00:46:27.584 --> 00:46:29.186
Isn't your mother acting strange?

00:46:29.953 --> 00:46:32.389
Mr. Lim came to see me, mother.

00:46:33.423 --> 00:46:35.192
Then why are you still standing there?

00:46:35.359 --> 00:46:38.128
I want to hug Soo Jin.

00:46:39.129 --> 00:46:40.964
But I'm dirty. I couldn't shower.

00:46:41.031 --> 00:46:42.966
It's okay now.

00:46:43.967 --> 00:46:45.002
Great.

00:46:45.402 --> 00:46:47.938
How do you feel?

00:46:49.773 --> 00:46:51.441
I'm a little scared.

00:46:54.545 --> 00:46:57.981
Yes, I heard you're going to have a hard time getting into the anesthesia room.

00:46:58.248 --> 00:47:00.150
But what did I say I would do for you?

00:47:00.584 --> 00:47:02.486
If you endured 13 days?

00:47:02.586 --> 00:47:04.555
Football, amusement park and ice cream.

00:47:04.621 --> 00:47:06.490
-What do you need then? -I must hold on.

00:47:06.557 --> 00:47:07.758
This is true.

00:47:08.592 --> 00:47:09.726
Kiss me.

00:47:14.097 --> 00:47:15.499
I'm really sorry.

00:47:16.567 --> 00:47:18.235
I told you I'm fine.

00:47:19.036 --> 00:47:21.405
No, not you. I feel sorry for Soo Jin.

00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:26.276
When she saw the news about the fugitive, she started to worry

00:47:26.343 --> 00:47:28.846
About you being busy and feeling bored without you.

00:47:28.912 --> 00:47:30.781
Did she really say that? Whew.

00:47:33.183 --> 00:47:36.453
If she should just leave me.

00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:41.592
I mean, what is this?

00:47:41.792 --> 00:47:44.995
I cannot support you in your most difficult circumstances.

00:47:46.563 --> 00:47:49.633
Why did he run away and make things difficult for all of us?

00:47:49.967 --> 00:47:52.836
I will catch that bastard even if I kill him.

00:47:53.537 --> 00:47:54.671
This is very heinous.

00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:58.242
I won't really kill him.

00:47:58.742 --> 00:48:00.377
This means that I will find him no matter what.

00:48:00.577 --> 00:48:04.014
But that bastard is a real monster.

00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:09.920
I don't want you to get hurt, so be careful.

00:48:11.054 --> 00:48:13.490
I will call you whenever I can to check on you

00:48:13.991 --> 00:48:15.592
And to hear about Soo Jin.

00:48:52.029 --> 00:48:53.230
Let's change our clothes.

00:49:02.839 --> 00:49:03.907
Let's go.

00:49:04.041 --> 00:49:08.845
"Bone marrow transplant"

00:49:08.912 --> 00:49:11.315
We will finally enter the anesthesia room.

00:49:11.381 --> 00:49:13.250
Mom, wait a minute.

00:49:14.451 --> 00:49:16.987
- What's wrong? -Are you sure?

00:49:18.288 --> 00:49:20.324
That I will get out of here alive?

00:49:22.759 --> 00:49:24.094
Of course.

00:49:24.895 --> 00:49:28.365
Don't worry and think about the promise you made to me and Mr. Lim.

00:49:29.032 --> 00:49:32.402
My mother. You love Mr. Lim, right?

00:49:33.203 --> 00:49:34.204
What?

00:49:34.271 --> 00:49:37.240
Mr. Lim loves you very much.

00:49:37.341 --> 00:49:39.743
So you started to like him too, right?

00:49:40.444 --> 00:49:41.945
Why are you asking me about that suddenly?

00:49:42.245 --> 00:49:43.714
I thought you liked him too.

00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:45.682
I didn't say I didn't love him.

00:49:47.417 --> 00:49:49.720
I love Mr Lim too.

00:49:51.121 --> 00:49:52.522
come in

00:49:54.091 --> 00:49:55.759
come in

00:50:09.573 --> 00:50:10.674
Is this all?

00:50:10.774 --> 00:50:12.542
Yes, it seems so.

00:50:14.077 --> 00:50:14.911
Prosecutor Park.

00:50:14.978 --> 00:50:16.747
Why did we find a receipt but not the camera?

00:50:17.314 --> 00:50:19.516
Mi Sook put the camera here on the day she was killed.

00:50:19.683 --> 00:50:21.985
If you elude me, I will charge you with destroying evidence.

00:50:23.086 --> 00:50:25.022
I am not the one who wrote this receipt.

00:50:25.088 --> 00:50:27.891
Tae San wrote it, this is his handwriting!

00:50:29.192 --> 00:50:30.360
"Jang Tae San"?

00:50:35.399 --> 00:50:37.034
Why Jang Tae San in particular?

00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:39.202
Why should it be Jang Tae San?

00:50:41.405 --> 00:50:43.540
She must have left the camera because she was worried

00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:45.609
For Moon Il Seok to take it from her.

00:50:45.976 --> 00:50:47.711
She didn't know that Jang Tae San works for himself.

00:50:47.778 --> 00:50:51.548
Maybe they killed her because she left the digital camera

00:50:52.482 --> 00:50:53.750
With Jang Tae San.

00:50:55.752 --> 00:50:57.654
Don't you know the places I frequented yet?

00:50:57.721 --> 00:51:00.690
I forgot about him since I saw him imprisoned for the second time in 2008.

00:51:00.757 --> 00:51:03.460
It turns out that he is a follower of Moon Il Seok, doing everything he asks.

00:51:03.693 --> 00:51:07.364
However, if he were imprisoned for murder in addition to his previous crimes,

00:51:07.431 --> 00:51:09.266
I'm sure he knows that he will be sentenced to life imprisonment.

00:51:09.332 --> 00:51:11.068
He must have promised him a big reward...

00:51:13.804 --> 00:51:15.572
But he has no family to give money to.

00:51:16.706 --> 00:51:19.676
Jang Tae San grew up in an orphanage.

00:51:22.546 --> 00:51:24.948
Can you find out what he was doing after 2008?

00:51:25.115 --> 00:51:26.450
I'll start from his time in Busan.

00:51:26.516 --> 00:51:28.785
She tells the story of the auction party that Cho Seo Hee will be holding.

00:51:29.119 --> 00:51:32.322
There's something fishy, ​​but I can't figure it out yet.

00:51:32.689 --> 00:51:33.757
Okay.

00:51:35.225 --> 00:51:36.593
By the way, Prosecutor Park.

00:51:37.828 --> 00:51:39.329
Moon Il Seok and Cho Seo Hee

00:51:39.996 --> 00:51:42.199
They will soon know that you came here.

00:51:42.265 --> 00:51:43.400
It doesn't matter.

00:51:43.733 --> 00:51:47.337
I will no longer continue the investigation in secret.

00:51:48.205 --> 00:51:49.706
I'll catch Jang Tae San

00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:52.843
And reveal all the crimes they hide.

00:51:57.247 --> 00:51:58.415
Yes, I'm Park Jae-kyung.

00:52:00.917 --> 00:52:02.419
Did you find Jang Tae San?

00:52:02.819 --> 00:52:03.820
Where did you find him?

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:06.823
A plaintiff named Park Jae-kyung came to the pawn shop?

00:52:09.025 --> 00:52:10.293
Digital camera?

00:52:15.298 --> 00:52:16.433
Listen.

00:52:17.067 --> 00:52:18.468
The plaintiff went to a pawn shop

00:52:18.535 --> 00:52:20.904
I looked for a digital camera that Mi Sook put there.

00:52:21.905 --> 00:52:25.041
The receipt said “Tae San,” but the camera isn’t in the closet.

00:52:25.308 --> 00:52:26.910
Oh Mi Suk left a camera there?

00:52:29.045 --> 00:52:30.847
Digital camera...

00:52:32.082 --> 00:52:34.751
What? Does that mean it's our picture?

00:52:35.051 --> 00:52:37.487
From outside the house?

00:52:39.389 --> 00:52:41.525
But all the curtains were drawn.

00:52:41.625 --> 00:52:43.994
If Prosecutor Park looked for it herself, it couldn't be an ordinary camera.

00:52:44.528 --> 00:52:46.830
If it was designed to catch you and Deputy Cho,

00:52:48.031 --> 00:52:49.933
It could have been equipped with a recording feature.

00:52:52.302 --> 00:52:53.436
Tell her I miss her.

00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:56.006
Yes, tell her I miss her.

00:52:56.473 --> 00:52:57.807
Don't forget to tell her that, okay?

00:52:59.376 --> 00:53:03.046
So the letter she left for Jae Kyung saying that she misses her

00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:05.615
Was it a password to tell her she had found evidence?

00:53:05.982 --> 00:53:07.150
Sir.

00:53:07.317 --> 00:53:09.419
If the camera wasn't in the pawn shop,

00:53:09.553 --> 00:53:11.454
This means that Jang Tae San took it.

00:53:26.403 --> 00:53:27.504
Yes, father.

00:53:29.906 --> 00:53:31.007
Yes.

00:53:35.579 --> 00:53:36.713
Okay.

00:53:41.318 --> 00:53:44.287
The bicycle was stolen from Nogam Village, Nogammyeon in Mungyeong,

00:53:44.454 --> 00:53:45.822
North Gyeongsang Province.

00:53:46.423 --> 00:53:48.325
The cutting machine was stolen in Wangneung.

00:53:48.391 --> 00:53:50.360
Which is 20 km from the village of “Nungam”.

00:53:50.527 --> 00:53:53.797
According to what the workers said, they worked until 2 am,

00:53:53.997 --> 00:53:56.866
So we can assume that Gang Tae San stole the cutting machine after that.

00:53:57.634 --> 00:54:00.837
It's an electric cutting machine, so he would need an electrical plug.

00:54:00.904 --> 00:54:03.039
He needed to go to a quiet place,

00:54:03.273 --> 00:54:07.077
Considering that it will take some time to cut the cuffs,

00:54:07.877 --> 00:54:10.614
We can assume that Jang Tae San

00:54:10.747 --> 00:54:12.916
Cutting off the handcuffs after 4 am.

00:54:13.049 --> 00:54:14.851
Some men were camping near the factory,

00:54:14.918 --> 00:54:16.820
Their clothes and shoes disappeared.

00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:19.923
He rode a motorcycle and a bicycle while handcuffed?

00:54:22.025 --> 00:54:24.561
He went to North Gyeongsang Province in just 8 and a half hours?

00:54:24.828 --> 00:54:28.331
We thought it would be somewhere near Yeongdeungpo.

00:54:28.698 --> 00:54:31.167
He cut off the handcuffs at 4 in the morning, and it is now 11:30 in the morning.

00:54:31.701 --> 00:54:33.303
So 7 and a half hours have passed.

00:54:33.370 --> 00:54:35.372
He has plenty of time to leave the area.

00:54:35.438 --> 00:54:37.741
I don't know how he managed to get there in handcuffs.

00:54:37.807 --> 00:54:41.278
But he did not rest for 8 hours and did not sleep either.

00:54:41.344 --> 00:54:44.014
Are you saying he might have hidden somewhere to sleep?

00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:46.783
Jang Tae San didn't eat a meal here.

00:54:47.317 --> 00:54:50.287
Can you last without food and sleep for two days straight?

00:54:50.353 --> 00:54:52.188
We are still inspecting highways and roads.

00:54:52.355 --> 00:54:53.723
So he couldn't have escaped in a car.

00:54:54.858 --> 00:54:58.128
They blocked all roads within a 30 km radius of that area and searched passing cars.

00:54:58.428 --> 00:55:00.730
Go to every village and search every house.

00:55:00.797 --> 00:55:02.599
And know if anyone heard the sound of a cutting machine.

00:55:02.666 --> 00:55:05.235
Let us ask the Minister of National Defense for help in searching the hills.

00:55:05.769 --> 00:55:07.537
He's already ahead of us.

00:55:07.604 --> 00:55:10.373
If his hands were free, he would be able to do anything. Let's move.

00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:13.176
Will you join us?

00:55:13.476 --> 00:55:14.711
Am I not allowed to go?

00:55:15.645 --> 00:55:18.048
Prosecutors do not work in the field.

00:55:27.624 --> 00:55:30.327
Stop there, you troublemaker!

00:55:31.628 --> 00:55:34.531
I will kill you as soon as I catch you.

00:55:35.532 --> 00:55:37.934
Ya said!

00:55:38.168 --> 00:55:39.836
Come here.

00:55:39.903 --> 00:55:42.005
Hey!

00:55:42.505 --> 00:55:43.907
You troublemaker!

00:55:46.643 --> 00:55:49.379
Where do you think you're going? Come here!

00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:51.614
Where are you going?

00:55:55.051 --> 00:55:56.252
You fool.

00:55:56.353 --> 00:55:58.755
Are you running away from me?

00:55:58.822 --> 00:56:01.224
Because you know you'll die as soon as I catch you?

00:56:01.725 --> 00:56:03.126
You troublemaker.

00:56:03.727 --> 00:56:06.096
Do you think I feed you with rice?

00:56:06.162 --> 00:56:08.498
Every morning and night for no reason?

00:56:08.932 --> 00:56:11.701
I should take care of my health

00:56:11.768 --> 00:56:13.870
If I would have lasted this summer.

00:56:13.970 --> 00:56:16.906
I don't have a husband or son to take care of me.

00:56:17.173 --> 00:56:20.343
My only means of living is food.

00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:21.745
Come here!

00:56:32.889 --> 00:56:34.057
Come here!

00:56:34.124 --> 00:56:36.259
This lady is strong-willed.

00:56:37.227 --> 00:56:39.963
- An hour has already passed. - Where are you going?

00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:42.665
I can't go out because she will see me.

00:56:44.534 --> 00:56:46.803
What time is it now?

00:56:48.171 --> 00:56:50.940
Let's see who will win the battle.

00:56:51.007 --> 00:56:53.610
I will make sure to catch you, even if it means that

00:56:53.676 --> 00:56:55.512
To eat you late at night.

00:56:56.513 --> 00:56:57.981
Wait!

00:57:07.757 --> 00:57:10.960
This is not a good time to laugh.

00:57:16.933 --> 00:57:18.168
I am very hungry.

00:57:19.235 --> 00:57:20.537
I am thirsty.

00:57:28.077 --> 00:57:29.646
Where will I hide?

00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:32.315
I don't have money.

00:57:33.883 --> 00:57:36.419
I am sure that the police are everywhere.

00:57:41.958 --> 00:57:44.527
I know, right? What will you do?

00:57:51.501 --> 00:57:54.437
I don't know. What should I do?

00:57:55.205 --> 00:57:57.841
What will you do?

00:58:02.512 --> 00:58:06.316
I wish I could stay hidden.

00:58:09.552 --> 00:58:10.887
If I get some food,

00:58:11.821 --> 00:58:13.456
I can wait here until the day of surgery.

00:58:27.303 --> 00:58:28.605
Thank heaven.

00:58:29.372 --> 00:58:30.840
I promised to return it to her.

00:58:34.777 --> 00:58:37.480
You promised me your pinky too.

00:58:37.614 --> 00:58:39.516
How will you return it to me?

00:58:40.183 --> 00:58:43.520
- What? - What was your plan when you escaped?

00:58:51.794 --> 00:58:53.763
I didn't have a plan.

00:58:56.633 --> 00:58:58.201
I didn't just want to die.

00:58:59.235 --> 00:59:00.637
I can't die

00:59:01.504 --> 00:59:02.939
Before surgery.

00:59:05.708 --> 00:59:08.144
But Moon Il Seok keeps trying to kill me,

00:59:09.178 --> 00:59:10.813
So I ran away for now.

00:59:13.716 --> 00:59:15.285
I should have stayed alive.

00:59:17.921 --> 00:59:20.590
How will you survive until the day of surgery?

00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:22.692
Are you hungry?

00:59:24.694 --> 00:59:25.795
You are right.

00:59:25.995 --> 00:59:28.431
I have an announcement for all residents.

00:59:28.765 --> 00:59:30.567
last night,

00:59:30.633 --> 00:59:33.169
A murder suspect escapes from Seoul

00:59:33.369 --> 00:59:36.472
It seems that he came to our village.

00:59:36.806 --> 00:59:39.008
Why is he trying to kill me?

00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:43.780
I don't really understand.

00:59:44.314 --> 00:59:46.883
He framed me for leaving my fingerprints

00:59:47.016 --> 00:59:48.785
And falsifying my alibi.

00:59:49.085 --> 00:59:52.288
After all that, why is he trying to kill me?

01:00:07.103 --> 01:00:08.972
What type of relationship?

01:00:09.639 --> 01:00:11.441
Who brought together Oh Mi Suk and Moon Il Seok?

01:00:15.311 --> 01:00:16.646
I wonder if Man-seok knew.

01:00:19.849 --> 01:00:21.017
Is there a phone here?

01:01:04.527 --> 01:01:06.396
You troublemaker!

01:01:06.496 --> 01:01:08.731
Where are you going?

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:16.839
Madam.

01:01:22.712 --> 01:01:24.147
The issue is,

01:01:25.348 --> 01:01:28.418
I lost my way in the mountain

01:01:28.718 --> 01:01:31.754
I ended up wandering here at night.

01:01:32.822 --> 01:01:33.890
What a shame.

01:01:34.424 --> 01:01:37.260
Looks like you had a rough night.

01:01:39.729 --> 01:01:40.997
- Madam. - Yes?

01:01:42.899 --> 01:01:46.002
Can I hold it for you?

01:01:46.169 --> 01:01:47.203
That troublemaker?

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:52.241
You must feel better.

01:01:52.308 --> 01:01:53.309
Excuse me?

01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:56.813
- Yes. - This damned chicken.

01:01:57.313 --> 01:01:58.815
I have a late lunch

01:01:58.881 --> 01:02:01.851
Because she kept running away from me.

01:02:07.957 --> 01:02:10.626
She was busy running away,

01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:12.595
So I got very fat.

01:02:12.695 --> 01:02:14.864
I have to say she is very good.

01:02:14.931 --> 01:02:16.399
I agree with you.

01:02:17.934 --> 01:02:19.302
By the way,

01:02:20.336 --> 01:02:22.605
Why did you go to the mountain without a bag?

01:02:22.839 --> 01:02:24.073
How brave you are.

01:02:27.276 --> 01:02:30.780
What about you? Aren't you afraid when you're alone?

01:02:32.415 --> 01:02:35.985
My nickname is Iron Granny.

01:02:36.319 --> 01:02:39.922
What could scare me? I'm not afraid of ghosts or humans.

01:02:42.425 --> 01:02:43.659
Aren't you afraid of ghosts?

01:02:43.726 --> 01:02:45.962
Why am I afraid of her?

01:02:46.028 --> 01:02:47.630
Rather, I should be afraid of humans.

01:02:48.131 --> 01:02:50.266
Humans are the ugliest creatures

01:02:50.333 --> 01:02:52.034
In the whole world.

01:02:54.837 --> 01:02:55.872
You are right.

01:02:57.206 --> 01:02:59.976
I'm afraid of people too.

01:03:00.042 --> 01:03:02.879
Iron Granny!

01:03:02.979 --> 01:03:04.113
Who is this?

01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:06.215
I am the sheikh of the town.

01:03:06.983 --> 01:03:08.785
What brought you here?

01:03:08.851 --> 01:03:10.253
Here you go.

01:03:12.054 --> 01:03:14.590
Sit down. Eat more.

01:03:16.025 --> 01:03:17.693
- Did your son come? - Yes.

01:03:18.127 --> 01:03:19.996
Hey, wait!

01:03:20.062 --> 01:03:21.931
Why does he run away?

01:03:22.031 --> 01:03:24.333
- What a shame. - The bicycle was stolen from the village of Nungam.

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:25.968
The cutting machine was stolen from Wangnyeong.

01:03:26.135 --> 01:03:27.904
We should focus on the region...

01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:29.272
They found Jang Tae San!

01:03:40.049 --> 01:03:42.018
"(Mungyeong)"

01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:03.206
"Mungyeong Police Volunteer"

01:04:35.171 --> 01:04:36.339
- “El Do.” - Yes, sir.

01:04:36.639 --> 01:04:39.108
Cross the river and walk along the gully.

01:04:39.175 --> 01:04:40.209
- Yes, sir. - Hurry.

01:04:42.745 --> 01:04:44.580
We don't know where he might have fled to.

01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:46.849
So they put some people on the other side as well.

01:05:45.274 --> 01:05:47.677
We haven't found it yet, what about you?

01:05:49.712 --> 01:05:50.846
Not here either.

01:05:52.048 --> 01:05:54.450
It will be dark soon, maybe he will hide in the forest.

01:05:54.517 --> 01:05:56.018
Make sure to inspect carefully.

01:06:22.378 --> 01:06:25.648
"Seo Soo Jin's Healing Calendar"

01:06:41.063 --> 01:06:42.231
It's Jang Tae San!

01:07:01.050 --> 01:07:02.752
Why did you visit Jang Taesan?

01:07:02.918 --> 01:07:04.253
How do you know that scoundrel?

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:06.722
Is he Soo Jin's biological father?

01:07:06.989 --> 01:07:09.558
If I catch Jang Tae San and find the camera...

01:07:09.625 --> 01:07:11.927
Is there a digital camera? Was I photographed?

01:07:12.395 --> 01:07:14.964
You should turn yourself in. Surrender yourself to save Soo Jin.

01:07:15.264 --> 01:07:18.601
Soo Jin has started receiving initial treatment, she can't back out now.

01:07:19.001 --> 01:07:22.271
She will die if surgery is not performed on her. She will die immediately.

01:07:22.538 --> 01:07:25.274
If I were in prison, Soo Jin wouldn't be able to have the surgery.

01:07:25.541 --> 01:07:28.310
Because I will die, I will end up dead.

01:07:28.677 --> 01:07:29.712
Digital camera...

01:07:30.346 --> 01:07:31.680
Yes, Man-seok has it.

01:07:33.149 --> 01:07:35.151
