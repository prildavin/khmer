The student of the deity

00:55.719 --> 01:02.059
Use your power to let me see

01:02.519 --> 01:08.729
As your student, help me go the right way

01:29.949 --> 01:31.119
Hey, lady.

01:31.218 --> 01:32.389
Lady!

01:32.489 --> 01:34.249
- Please save us!
- Please save us!

01:34.318 --> 01:35.458
- Lady!
- Please save us!

01:35.458 --> 01:37.458
- They're trying to kill us!
- Please save us!

01:37.755 --> 01:39.555
- Make him quiet.
- Save us!

01:39.812 --> 01:41.082
Save us!

01:41.082 --> 01:43.052
- Lady!
- Please save us!

01:43.222 --> 01:45.452
- Help us!
- Save us!

01:45.452 --> 01:47.052
Help us!

01:47.151 --> 01:49.491
- Help us!
- Save us!

01:49.591 --> 01:51.022
Save us!

01:51.222 --> 01:52.862
Save us!

01:52.961 --> 01:54.931
- Save us!
- Lady!

01:54.931 --> 01:56.401
Save us!

01:56.502 --> 01:58.032
- Save us!
- Lady!

01:58.162 --> 02:01.131
Save us!

02:01.741 --> 02:03.172
Lady!

02:19.121 --> 02:20.252
You...

02:21.052 --> 02:22.261
have to kill that kid.

02:25.231 --> 02:26.991
If you let him live,

02:27.392 --> 02:28.631
you'll die...

02:28.731 --> 02:30.662
and so will everyone else.

02:31.702 --> 02:32.832
You must...

02:33.532 --> 02:37.371
kill that kid.

02:58.322 --> 03:02.102
(Episode 8: Murder Notice)

03:30.422 --> 03:32.132
I got a statement from the bride's helper.

03:33.632 --> 03:35.132
- Tell me.
- The bride was changing...

03:35.132 --> 03:36.901
into her reception dress by herself,

03:37.302 --> 03:39.232
and the helper came back to get her...

03:40.332 --> 03:41.531
and found her like this.

03:41.531 --> 03:44.602
So an employee was outside waiting, but the culprit came in?

03:44.602 --> 03:46.471
She said she stepped away for a moment...

03:47.012 --> 03:48.512
when the bride's father collapsed.

04:03.591 --> 04:04.892
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

04:05.431 --> 04:07.591
We'll contact you separately.

04:07.661 --> 04:09.431
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

04:12.172 --> 04:13.272
Excuse me.

04:13.501 --> 04:16.940
Everyone that was here today...

04:17.101 --> 04:20.411
will get calls separately.

04:20.411 --> 04:23.311
You can come to the police station then...

04:23.542 --> 04:27.882
and give your statements as testifiers.

04:31.052 --> 04:32.221
Then...

04:32.591 --> 04:34.052
does that mean we can go?

04:34.221 --> 04:36.022
Yes. You can go.

04:38.491 --> 04:39.561
Detective Na.

04:39.632 --> 04:40.931
Where's Captain Oh?

04:40.931 --> 04:42.061
In the bridal suite.

04:42.661 --> 04:44.762
I think we should take a look at the CCTV footage.

04:45.971 --> 04:47.171
The CCTV footage?

05:01.281 --> 05:02.452
Hold on.

05:03.122 --> 05:04.382
It's An Tae Ho.

05:05.082 --> 05:06.091
Are you sure?

05:06.091 --> 05:07.651
This isn't my first day on the job.

05:07.721 --> 05:09.762
Do you think I wouldn't recognize him because he covered his face?

05:11.214 --> 05:12.654
It's An Tae Ho.

05:12.654 --> 05:14.414
I think it's An Tae Ho as well.

05:14.414 --> 05:16.253
What are you doing? Put out an APB for An Tae Ho.

05:16.253 --> 05:17.323
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go.

05:32.573 --> 05:35.204
An Tae Ho stayed hidden at the wedding reception venue.

05:35.573 --> 05:38.974
Then when Director Kang drank the champagne and collapsed,

05:40.073 --> 05:41.573
he left the venue right away.

05:41.743 --> 05:43.613
- Gosh, what is going on?
- Did you see what happened?

05:43.613 --> 05:44.784
Someone collapsed?

05:47.313 --> 05:50.024
- Oh, gosh!
- Mr. Kang!

05:50.623 --> 05:52.224
- Mr. Kang!
- Make way!

05:53.654 --> 05:55.154
What happened?

05:55.154 --> 05:56.823
He collapsed!

05:57.164 --> 05:58.764
What's going on?

05:58.764 --> 06:01.264
- Goodness.
- Did you see what happened?

06:04.003 --> 06:05.704
That is so shocking.

06:08.173 --> 06:09.873
And then I followed him out.

06:25.753 --> 06:28.923
Right, and that's when I lost An Tae Ho.

06:30.493 --> 06:31.594
Darn it.

06:32.764 --> 06:35.704
Sung Hoon. Weren't you at the wedding hall too?

06:39.104 --> 06:40.933
- What?
- As I was chasing after An Tae Ho,

06:40.933 --> 06:42.604
I saw someone who looked like you.

06:43.503 --> 06:45.373
You know I don't go to places like that.

06:47.313 --> 06:49.743
Figures. You don't even go to your own school reunions.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.584
There's no way you would've gone to a wedding.

06:58.854 --> 07:01.923
There is a connection between this case and An Tae Ho.

07:04.024 --> 07:07.794
You assume he's the culprit because of a bloody wedding invitation...

07:07.794 --> 07:09.204
and the fact that he was there?

07:09.764 --> 07:12.573
If that's the case, you were at the scene too.

07:13.173 --> 07:14.474
Why are you picking a fight?

07:14.633 --> 07:16.803
Why? Do you still suspect me?

07:16.803 --> 07:18.274
The way you investigate...

07:18.644 --> 07:21.474
is illogical and unscientific. That's what I'm trying to say.

07:22.284 --> 07:24.383
Illogical and unscientific?

07:25.383 --> 07:26.454
Fine.

07:26.613 --> 07:28.784
A genius like you has a brain that works fast,

07:28.784 --> 07:30.823
so everything is so logical and scientific for you.

07:30.823 --> 07:32.053
But I'm not like that.

07:32.294 --> 07:35.253
I'm not smart, so I have to tackle things head-on at the crime scene...

07:35.253 --> 07:37.623
and run around until I'm sweating all over...

07:37.823 --> 07:38.964
to find a tiny piece of evidence.

07:39.563 --> 07:41.933
So what if that's unscientific and illogical?

07:42.334 --> 07:43.764
All that matters is that I catch the culprit.

07:43.764 --> 07:46.474
So the culprit that you managed to catch was Jung Man Chun?

07:46.474 --> 07:48.733
You're the one who gave Jung Man Chun a guilty verdict!

07:48.733 --> 07:50.803
You're the one who brought in contaminated evidence!

07:50.803 --> 07:53.544
- Did I do that on purpose?
- What are you two doing?

08:03.154 --> 08:04.854
You know what happened today, right?

08:05.024 --> 08:06.123
Someone died.

08:06.123 --> 08:08.423
And it was a bride who had just walked down the aisle.

08:08.964 --> 08:11.063
But do you guys have enough time to argue about your feelings?

08:11.794 --> 08:12.964
Ryu Sung Jun.

08:13.433 --> 08:15.733
Do you think I helped you despite the risks so that you could do this?

08:17.204 --> 08:18.264
No.

08:19.104 --> 08:20.373
Judge Ryu Sung Hoon.

08:20.873 --> 08:23.303
If you can't trust your brother that much, just call the police.

08:23.673 --> 08:25.144
Stop being so cheap.

08:27.373 --> 08:29.414
What are you doing? Seriously, are you guys children?

08:38.123 --> 08:40.453
It seemed like the police discovered something.

08:40.753 --> 08:42.964
But I couldn't ask about it because Seok Gu looked too busy.

08:43.224 --> 08:44.764
Ask him once some time has passed.

08:51.204 --> 08:52.933
I'll look into it later.

08:56.443 --> 08:57.704
I need to go to the bathroom.

09:14.553 --> 09:16.124
We have An Tae Ho coming out of the bride's waiting room...

09:16.124 --> 09:17.294
on the security footage.

09:17.723 --> 09:19.034
I knew it.

09:19.933 --> 09:21.234
Where is An Tae Ho now?

09:21.234 --> 09:23.004
We can't locate him. His phone is turned off too.

09:23.164 --> 09:24.833
So he's already going under the radar?

09:25.534 --> 09:27.173
Can you send me a list...

09:27.173 --> 09:28.734
of all of An Tae Ho's previous residences?

09:29.103 --> 09:31.343
- Sure, I can.
- Oh, and Seok Gu.

09:32.874 --> 09:34.973
Did I ever tell you this?

09:35.244 --> 09:36.313
So...

09:36.914 --> 09:38.343
Tell me what?

09:39.083 --> 09:40.114
Thank...

09:41.654 --> 09:42.923
So, I mean...

09:43.583 --> 09:45.524
Work hard while you can.

09:45.524 --> 09:48.053
Stick by the captain and the others to learn everything well.

09:48.853 --> 09:51.664
Of course, it's a shame that I'm not there...

09:51.664 --> 09:54.034
when I am such a great role model.

09:54.563 --> 09:57.433
What can you do? You're just unlucky.

09:57.933 --> 09:59.673
Just worry about yourself.

10:00.534 --> 10:01.603
Okay.

10:01.933 --> 10:04.144
I'll see you when we catch An Tae Ho.

10:17.853 --> 10:19.624
Gosh, how did he find out?

10:20.853 --> 10:21.853
Key.

10:23.164 --> 10:26.264
Hey, Sung Hoon. I just talked to Seok Gu,

10:26.463 --> 10:28.764
- and An Tae Ho was seen...
- Give me the keys.

10:37.473 --> 10:39.213
- Get in.
- Forget it.

10:40.014 --> 10:41.313
Just get in.

11:07.433 --> 11:10.203
(Kim Seok Gu)

11:20.154 --> 11:22.784
Where are you headed first? Type in the address.

11:24.083 --> 11:25.284
What address?

11:28.624 --> 11:30.093
(Juror Jo Eun Ki)

11:31.624 --> 11:33.933
- Hello?
- Hey, Eun Ki. It's me.

11:34.264 --> 11:36.764
Sung Jun will send you Manager An's address list now.

11:36.764 --> 11:37.764
Okay.

11:38.203 --> 11:40.673
We have to find someone who might know where he is.

11:41.203 --> 11:43.274
We'll visit his most recent addresses first.

11:43.274 --> 11:46.073
Please look into the oldest ones.

11:46.213 --> 11:47.544
Okay. I'll do that.

11:51.443 --> 11:54.284
Sung Hoon. Did you perhaps plant a bug on me?

11:54.284 --> 11:56.323
Why would I go through the trouble of doing that?

11:56.453 --> 11:59.394
Then how did you know I was tracking down An Tae Ho?

11:59.394 --> 12:02.563
Your brain is too clear.

12:03.193 --> 12:06.164
I always wondered how criminals ever got caught by a guy like you.

12:06.164 --> 12:09.234
That's because criminals are right on the same level as me.

12:09.563 --> 12:11.333
If you try to use your brain, it gets even more tangled.

12:14.833 --> 12:16.573
(North Chungcheong Province, Gyeonggi Province, Incheon)

12:16.874 --> 12:19.414
Why did An Tae Ho move around so much?

12:19.414 --> 12:21.573
Most of the stuff found in the container...

12:21.573 --> 12:23.644
was for camping or single-use items.

12:24.284 --> 12:26.284
He has no intention of settling down anywhere.

12:28.884 --> 12:33.394
What was this punk doing moving around the entire country?

12:37.823 --> 12:39.333
(North Chungcheong Province)

12:39.333 --> 12:42.433
(20-5, Byeonsa-ri, Seorae, North Chungcheong Province)

12:42.803 --> 12:44.034
(20-5, Byeonsa-ri, Seorae, North Chungcheong Province)

12:44.034 --> 12:47.134
Hi, do you have a record of a child named An Tae Ho there?

12:47.134 --> 12:48.173
An Tae Ho?

12:48.173 --> 12:50.404
He had a big burn mark on the back of his hand.

12:51.703 --> 12:53.544
Oh, I see. Yes.

12:53.544 --> 12:55.213
Yes, thank you.

12:57.213 --> 12:59.384
(20-5, Byeonsa-ri, Seorae, North Chungcheong Province)

13:01.353 --> 13:04.423
(427-14, Sangho-dong, Seorae, North Chungcheong Province)

13:04.524 --> 13:06.053
(427-14, Sangho-dong, Seorae, North Chungcheong Province)

13:09.693 --> 13:12.323
(16, Boheung-ro 204beon-gil, Yangdo-eup, Soho, Gyeonggi Province)

13:21.933 --> 13:22.943
Sung Hoon.

13:49.603 --> 13:50.963
That hits the spot.

13:51.634 --> 13:52.703
It's good.

14:09.984 --> 14:12.494
- Here.
- Forget it. You eat it.

14:13.593 --> 14:14.624
Thanks.

14:19.833 --> 14:23.004
This situation must not be that hard for you.

14:24.463 --> 14:26.203
Does anything change if I think that it's hard?

14:27.534 --> 14:29.874
Besides, I like how it is now.

14:31.103 --> 14:32.774
I get to eat with you.

14:43.683 --> 14:45.453
This reminds me of old times.

14:48.193 --> 14:50.764
The ramyeon you made me back then was so salty.

14:52.264 --> 14:53.294
Salty?

14:54.634 --> 14:56.164
Didn't you say it was good?

14:56.164 --> 14:58.264
Come on. I was starving.

14:58.264 --> 14:59.774
I had to say it was good if I wanted to eat something.

15:00.404 --> 15:01.874
All you ever made me was ramyeon.

15:03.774 --> 15:06.173
Hey. Whose fault was that?

15:06.514 --> 15:08.313
The money that Mother gave us for food...

15:08.644 --> 15:10.614
was all spent on paying for settling with the kids you beat up.

15:11.213 --> 15:13.853
Sometimes that wasn't even enough, so I had to dip into my savings.

15:16.183 --> 15:18.923
And then you'd be shameless enough to whine about being hungry.

15:19.853 --> 15:22.453
I made a punk like you ramyeon, and now what do you say?

15:22.994 --> 15:23.994
It was salty?

15:24.524 --> 15:26.034
All I ever made you was ramyeon?

15:36.203 --> 15:37.443
You're so weird.

15:38.573 --> 15:40.644
You clearly show you don't want to do it,

15:40.774 --> 15:42.244
but you do whatever I ask.

15:44.484 --> 15:45.914
I was a scumbag.

15:46.384 --> 15:49.384
You'd just had a nosebleed from studying all night,

15:49.853 --> 15:53.823
and I demanded you cook me ramyeon or I'd go out and beat up someone.

15:58.593 --> 15:59.734
But...

16:02.134 --> 16:03.664
I had no other choice.

16:09.374 --> 16:10.703
You never looked at me otherwise.

16:18.744 --> 16:21.953
That was the only time I ever felt happy.

16:24.124 --> 16:25.553
When I sat across from you...

16:26.723 --> 16:28.294
and we ate together.

16:31.463 --> 16:32.593
It felt like...

16:33.963 --> 16:35.734
we were family.

16:46.343 --> 16:47.673
I wish I could have ramyeon.

16:49.683 --> 16:51.313
Gimbap and ramyeon is the best combination.

17:47.573 --> 17:49.034
(Spring Light)

17:49.843 --> 17:50.974
Let's go.

17:51.044 --> 17:52.843
- Can you carry that?
- Yes.

17:53.444 --> 17:54.544
Can you really?

17:54.544 --> 17:55.843
- Watch your step.
- Okay.

17:56.214 --> 17:59.313
Wow, Ye Seo, you're really strong.

17:59.583 --> 18:00.784
I'll get the door for you.

18:09.593 --> 18:10.863
Hold Mom's hand.

18:10.994 --> 18:12.093
- Let's go.
- Excuse me.

18:13.934 --> 18:15.264
May I ask you something?

18:17.563 --> 18:19.674
Do you know an An Tae Ho...

18:19.674 --> 18:21.504
who used to live here?

18:21.704 --> 18:23.004
Mr. An?

18:24.504 --> 18:25.974
Yes, I know him well.

18:27.244 --> 18:29.214
Who are you?

18:29.583 --> 18:30.684
Oh, I'm...

18:31.143 --> 18:32.284
a friend.

18:49.734 --> 18:52.534
I didn't know Mr. An had friends.

18:53.873 --> 18:55.434
I didn't think he would.

18:56.674 --> 18:59.944
May I ask how you know him?

19:05.244 --> 19:06.715
Mr. An...

19:06.715 --> 19:10.014
saved the lives of me and my son.

19:12.115 --> 19:14.324
If it hadn't been for him,

19:14.324 --> 19:16.024
my son and I...

19:17.994 --> 19:19.625
wouldn't be here.

19:42.484 --> 19:43.514
(Public Restroom)

19:47.554 --> 19:49.494
(Cheongeum-ji Public Restroom)

19:56.734 --> 19:57.834
Hey, you.

20:03.034 --> 20:04.234
Are you in pain?

20:07.645 --> 20:09.814
If you're having a baby, go to a hospital.

20:10.415 --> 20:11.675
Not a restroom.

20:15.185 --> 20:16.984
Why do you care...

20:17.955 --> 20:19.584
where I have my baby?

20:19.685 --> 20:20.855
Wait here.

20:20.885 --> 20:22.185
I'll call an ambulance.

20:22.355 --> 20:23.395
Don't.

20:24.324 --> 20:25.625
If you make the call,

20:26.324 --> 20:28.794
I'll bite my tongue and die on the spot.

20:59.350 --> 21:01.390
Then he hurt his leg...

21:03.513 --> 21:04.613
Yes.

21:06.827 --> 21:08.758
Whenever I see him,

21:09.330 --> 21:11.541
I feel guilty and upset.

21:13.302 --> 21:15.062
He limps now because of me.

21:17.772 --> 21:19.111
I found out that...

21:20.134 --> 21:23.535
he'd been building a home for single moms...

21:24.141 --> 21:26.210
in our neighborhood.

21:28.964 --> 21:30.675
The place where we met outside.

21:32.588 --> 21:34.288
It's the shelter for single moms...

21:35.655 --> 21:37.085
that Mr. An built.

21:43.346 --> 21:45.346
A boy with a burn mark on the back of his hand.

21:45.417 --> 21:46.586
I remember him.

21:46.687 --> 21:49.016
Was the boy's name An Tae Ho?

21:49.117 --> 21:50.826
That's right, An Tae Ho.

21:51.187 --> 21:54.397
I remember his name because it was a dreadful mark on a boy so young.

21:54.957 --> 21:57.727
He came to our orphanage from somewhere else,

21:57.826 --> 22:00.237
and I heard his mom had him while she was single.

22:00.237 --> 22:02.596
Did he have any friends...

22:02.596 --> 22:04.806
or relatives I could contact?

22:05.066 --> 22:06.437
No.

22:06.737 --> 22:10.407
He was with us for a few years before going to another orphanage.

22:10.746 --> 22:12.947
Do you remember what the place was called?

22:13.516 --> 22:14.816
I'm not sure.

22:15.316 --> 22:18.217
It was Hope-something.

22:18.516 --> 22:21.316
It was so long ago, I can't be sure.

22:22.617 --> 22:24.227
Okay, thank you.

22:26.727 --> 22:29.556

(Bosin-ro 23, Sosan-myeon, Seosan-gu, Muyeong City)

23:00.856 --> 23:02.056
So...

23:02.326 --> 23:05.127
when did you meet Mr. An?

23:06.026 --> 23:07.437
In high school?

23:07.467 --> 23:10.036
Yes. A long time ago.

23:31.978 --> 23:33.048
Mom.

23:34.188 --> 23:36.218
Watch me.

23:44.659 --> 23:45.758
No.

23:46.329 --> 23:47.429
No.

23:49.669 --> 23:50.768
Mom!

23:52.438 --> 23:53.569
What are you doing?

23:54.139 --> 23:55.268
Who are you?

23:55.669 --> 23:57.139
How dare you touch my kid?

24:00.978 --> 24:02.048
I'm...

24:04.149 --> 24:05.278
I'm sorry.

24:05.278 --> 24:06.478
Who are you?

24:09.748 --> 24:10.889
I'm sorry.

24:12.559 --> 24:13.659
Are you okay?

24:24.198 --> 24:26.198
I should go now. Thank you.

24:26.609 --> 24:27.738
Bye.

24:42.718 --> 24:44.018
What was that about?

24:49.387 --> 24:50.556
I don't know...

24:51.326 --> 24:52.556
why I did what I did.

24:55.526 --> 24:56.596
I just thought...

24:58.026 --> 25:00.066
the kid would fall.

25:03.266 --> 25:05.366
Do you remember what happened to you as a kid?

25:28.257 --> 25:30.096
Can you do anything right?

25:32.866 --> 25:35.937
You said you'd use An Tae Ho as bait to catch Yoon Jae.

25:36.167 --> 25:38.007
That's why although he shouldn't have been released,

25:38.007 --> 25:39.566
I let him go.

25:39.566 --> 25:42.477
Then you should've linked him to Yoon Jae and gotten rid of them.

25:42.637 --> 25:45.007
There was another murder because of you.

25:45.207 --> 25:46.917
Who was killed this time?

25:47.076 --> 25:49.816
She was the daughter of a juror Hye Jin did jury duty with.

25:51.616 --> 25:54.356
- A juror?
- I think his name is Kang Young Ki.

25:55.086 --> 25:56.687
Do you know who that is?

26:00.026 --> 26:01.957
I don't remember his name exactly,

26:02.727 --> 26:05.366
but 20 years ago, there was a guy named Mr. Kang,

26:06.766 --> 26:08.566
ad he was a supplier at Hope Welfare Center.

26:17.076 --> 26:18.376
What happened?

26:20.717 --> 26:23.747
He disappeared after we found out he wasn't who I thought he was.

26:25.316 --> 26:26.417
What do you mean?

26:26.417 --> 26:29.487
It turns out An Tae Ho was a good person...

26:29.927 --> 26:32.126
who made shelters for single mothers who had no place to go.

26:34.457 --> 26:37.197
What about you? Did you find out anything?

26:37.826 --> 26:38.866
No.

26:39.566 --> 26:42.596
I called all the orphanages that An Tae Ho stayed in,

26:43.207 --> 26:45.137
but none of them still kept in touch with him.

26:46.167 --> 26:47.507
It seems that An Tae Ho...

26:47.977 --> 26:51.276
has no friends or family and lives a lonely life.

27:07.126 --> 27:08.397
Hey, Yoon Jae.

27:27.247 --> 27:29.816
- Did your mom call you?
- What do you think?

27:34.217 --> 27:35.556
Are you going to the shelter?

27:36.086 --> 27:37.887
No. I want to go to the center.

27:37.887 --> 27:39.026
You can't go there.

27:40.397 --> 27:41.826
Why are you yelling?

27:43.056 --> 27:44.096
Me?

27:45.197 --> 27:46.227
I didn't.

27:47.296 --> 27:48.796
I heard you were staying in the night-duty room.

27:49.096 --> 27:51.366
It's scary to sleep alone. I'll stay with you.

27:51.366 --> 27:53.237
No, I'm a light sleeper,

27:53.437 --> 27:55.407
so I can't sleep with other people around.

27:55.977 --> 27:57.447
You slept just fine here.

27:57.447 --> 28:00.177
This place is different. Either way, you can't stay at the center.

28:01.147 --> 28:03.687
You should go to the shelter and stay with kids your age.

28:04.846 --> 28:06.247
How suspicious.

28:06.786 --> 28:08.757
Why are you avoiding eye contact as you say that?

28:10.126 --> 28:12.727
Ms. Jo, are you hiding something from me?

28:12.856 --> 28:15.526
Hey. What would I be hiding from you?

28:22.697 --> 28:24.907
- Hello, Detective Kim.
- Tell Sung Jun to hide.

28:24.907 --> 28:26.776
Detective Kang is headed over there.

28:27.407 --> 28:28.536
Okay.

28:29.536 --> 28:32.606
Yu Na, something urgent came up, so I need to go.

28:32.606 --> 28:34.276
Everything's ready for your discharge,

28:34.276 --> 28:35.977
so go straight to the shelter. Got it?

28:36.417 --> 28:37.447
Bye!

28:45.157 --> 28:46.927
Detective Ryu. You need to get up.

28:46.927 --> 28:48.826
Hurry. Get up now!

28:49.026 --> 28:50.667
- What?
- The police are coming.

28:50.667 --> 28:51.826
You have to get out of here.

28:52.566 --> 28:54.036
- Right now!
- Hold on.

29:03.507 --> 29:04.546
Okay.

29:06.576 --> 29:08.546
- What's up with you two?
- Hey.

29:10.387 --> 29:11.447
What the...

29:11.447 --> 29:13.487
Are you sending me to the shelter because of him?

29:17.126 --> 29:18.586
What are the two of you doing here?

29:19.487 --> 29:20.757
Are you dating?

29:20.927 --> 29:23.227
- Yu Na, it's not like that...
- If you're not dating,

29:23.227 --> 29:25.066
why are you hiding a serial murderer?

29:25.066 --> 29:27.397
Hey. I'm not a serial murderer.

29:27.667 --> 29:29.066
If you're not, why are you hiding?

29:29.066 --> 29:31.066
Yu Na, we don't have the time to explain it to you.

29:31.066 --> 29:33.937
- Let's go outside.
- I should report you.

29:34.336 --> 29:36.036
How much was the reward for turning in a serial murderer again?

29:36.036 --> 29:37.447
- Hey!
- Hey!

29:39.407 --> 29:41.217
I told you I'm not a serial murderer!

29:41.217 --> 29:44.016
And honestly, shouldn't you be grateful to me?

29:44.286 --> 29:48.316
I saved you at that club!

29:48.316 --> 29:49.516
Who saved whom?

29:49.516 --> 29:51.556
You're the one who caught junkies because of me.

29:51.887 --> 29:53.056
- No...
- Fine.

29:53.626 --> 29:54.757
I won't report you.

29:55.657 --> 29:57.497
But in return, I need to get a reward.

29:57.727 --> 29:59.766
Yu Na, what's up with you today?

29:59.766 --> 30:01.836
- Let's go out.
- I don't want to.

30:08.637 --> 30:10.007
Who is that guy?

30:10.876 --> 30:14.477
He's the judge who imprisoned the junkie...

30:15.016 --> 30:17.316
who tried to cut you with the scalpel.

30:23.556 --> 30:26.086
This guy is really that judge?

30:26.957 --> 30:28.197
Are you happy now that you know?

30:28.197 --> 30:29.296
Let's go.

30:32.526 --> 30:33.697
Let me join you.

30:34.467 --> 30:36.497
I don't know what the three of you are doing,

30:36.497 --> 30:37.707
but let me join too.

30:38.566 --> 30:40.477
If you don't, I'm going to report him.

30:48.619 --> 30:49.689
My gosh.

31:39.639 --> 31:41.879
One, two three.

31:43.379 --> 31:45.949
- Freeze!
- What's going on?

32:36.559 --> 32:37.559
Let's go.

32:50.479 --> 32:51.908
We're looking for a suspect.

32:52.838 --> 32:54.749
It seems you came to the wrong place.

32:55.878 --> 32:57.918
- Sung Jun isn't here.
- That's odd.

32:58.319 --> 33:00.049
He called Detective Kim on a phone...

33:01.319 --> 33:02.918
located here.

33:11.529 --> 33:12.829
That's my phone.

33:13.198 --> 33:16.299
Didn't Seok Gu tell you that he was dating me?

33:17.499 --> 33:19.338
- No way.
- No.

33:20.098 --> 33:21.408
He didn't mention it.

33:25.608 --> 33:27.079
If you get it, please leave.

33:27.479 --> 33:29.309
We're in the middle of a Mentor-Mentee Class.

33:31.549 --> 33:33.118
(Mentor-Mentee Class)

33:36.519 --> 33:37.519
A mentor?

33:37.959 --> 33:39.658
Instead of mentoring other people,

33:39.888 --> 33:41.888
why don't you guide your brother on the right path?

33:42.388 --> 33:43.759
Listen here, Detective Kang.

33:47.868 --> 33:49.229
I apologize for the inconvenience.

34:12.388 --> 34:15.128
Do you think he'll be back? I think he's still suspicious.

34:15.289 --> 34:17.398
I think we should be more careful for the time being.

34:17.759 --> 34:20.259
Try to avoid coming into the storage room.

34:20.598 --> 34:21.628
Okay.

34:28.309 --> 34:30.978
You too, Sung Jun. Don't roam around on your own.

34:31.608 --> 34:32.638
Okay.

34:35.608 --> 34:37.518
We should call it a day.

34:38.879 --> 34:41.149
What? Is this how it's ending?

34:46.589 --> 34:48.027
Isn't there anything else?

34:48.388 --> 34:50.598
Isn't there anything else? What about me?

34:50.598 --> 34:52.728
What about you? It's time to go to the shelter. Hurry up and go.

34:52.728 --> 34:55.129
My gosh. How boring.

35:04.972 --> 35:06.112
Gosh, that was close.

35:07.311 --> 35:08.412
Are you okay?

35:08.782 --> 35:10.211
Yes, and you?

35:16.891 --> 35:18.992
Eun Ki, your phone's ringing.

35:22.992 --> 35:24.262
Yes, hello?

35:25.162 --> 35:26.492
Yes, this is she.

35:28.302 --> 35:29.501
Oh, I see.

35:30.231 --> 35:31.371
Yes, thank you.

35:31.371 --> 35:33.402
At noon? Okay.

35:35.941 --> 35:37.041
Is something the matter?

35:37.041 --> 35:38.141
They asked me to come in to make a witness statement...

35:38.141 --> 35:39.671
for Director Kang's daughter's case.

35:39.742 --> 35:41.041
Is that so?

35:43.081 --> 35:44.211
I'll be back.

35:49.121 --> 35:50.291
See you later.

35:50.791 --> 35:52.092
Get some rest.

36:00.202 --> 36:02.132
Where are you going? The courthouse?

36:04.271 --> 36:05.371
Don't you have a car?

36:07.342 --> 36:08.842
I want to see the judge's room.

36:08.842 --> 36:10.041
Will you let me see it?

36:12.242 --> 36:13.242
Mister.

36:13.242 --> 36:15.981
Did you really throw that junkie in jail?

36:16.012 --> 36:17.012
Why?

36:19.652 --> 36:20.882
What do you mean why?

36:20.882 --> 36:22.421
They all said back then,

36:22.552 --> 36:25.021
that his dad would bribe people to get him probation.

36:25.592 --> 36:26.722
Oh, right.

36:26.722 --> 36:28.521
Did his dad not pay you enough?

36:29.662 --> 36:31.132
The verdict I gave him...

36:31.132 --> 36:32.831
was based on the law and on principles.

36:32.831 --> 36:33.862
I see.

36:33.862 --> 36:35.461
The law and principles?

36:36.262 --> 36:38.202

What are you still doing here?

37:21.711 --> 37:23.041
I was waiting for you.

37:23.041 --> 37:24.751
- We should eat.
- We should.

37:26.711 --> 37:28.981
I've been busy since this morning, so I haven't eaten anything all day.

37:29.052 --> 37:30.452
Let's go to Sosoo.

37:30.452 --> 37:31.652
Everyone is there.

37:42.561 --> 37:43.802
Thank you.

37:45.072 --> 37:46.171
So...

37:47.001 --> 37:48.501
What did the detective say to the two of you?

37:50.311 --> 37:54.112
He asked me to speak in detail about what I saw at the wedding.

37:55.242 --> 37:56.412
Me too.

37:56.412 --> 37:59.311
And he asked me if I saw Manager An at the wedding hall.

38:00.952 --> 38:02.351
He asked you too?

38:02.351 --> 38:05.751
I told you. The police suspect Manager An is the culprit.

38:07.592 --> 38:08.762
Then...

38:09.021 --> 38:10.791
What's up with Detective Ryu Sung Jun?

38:12.092 --> 38:15.501
Didn't Detective Ryu kill Baek Ji Eun and Yeom Hye Jin?

38:16.561 --> 38:19.532
Aren't those cases and this one not related?

38:19.532 --> 38:21.202
Why aren't they related?

38:21.202 --> 38:22.871
Baek Ji Eun and Coco Mom.

38:22.871 --> 38:25.912
And even Director Kang's daughter. They're all connected.

38:27.112 --> 38:28.441
What do you mean by that?

38:28.742 --> 38:30.882
How are those three connected?

38:34.822 --> 38:36.081
Mr. Bae.

38:36.182 --> 38:38.552
Do you know something about this case?

38:41.322 --> 38:42.521
Well...

38:42.592 --> 38:44.391
What would I know?

38:51.402 --> 38:54.141
All three of them had their mouths cut.

38:54.141 --> 38:56.771
Gosh, I thought it was something more.

kind of serious.

39:59.101 --> 40:00.441
I'll try clicking on the link.

40:10.652 --> 40:12.581
What? That's An Tae Ho.

40:13.882 --> 40:15.081
What is this?

40:17.251 --> 40:19.322
Isn't that Manager An?

40:20.561 --> 40:21.822
What is this?

40:21.921 --> 40:24.362
I think it is Manager An.

40:50.282 --> 40:51.822
(Brother)

40:52.921 --> 40:54.021
Hey.

40:55.191 --> 40:56.362
I saw it too.

40:59.532 --> 41:00.961
Okay. I'll be right there.

41:11.941 --> 41:13.671
Someone, please call the police.

41:14.211 --> 41:16.112
I'll call them. It's on my phone too.

41:16.311 --> 41:17.952
- I'll head out first.
- I'll come with you.

41:23.351 --> 41:24.492
Goodness.

41:25.322 --> 41:26.921
We need to perform an exorcism or something.

41:27.262 --> 41:28.921
We'll all end up dead at this rate.

41:39.001 --> 41:41.871
Every hour, the noose is being tightened automatically.

41:42.302 --> 41:43.771
There are 19 hours left.

41:49.112 --> 41:50.182
Sung Hoon.

41:51.081 --> 41:53.751
Couldn't this be a recorded video?

41:56.351 --> 41:59.751
What reason would they have to send it out as if it were a live stream?

42:00.191 --> 42:01.492
Darn it.

42:04.092 --> 42:05.331
The culprit is planning...

42:05.662 --> 42:08.532
to publicly execute An Tae Ho as we all watch.

42:09.262 --> 42:10.501
Publicly execute him?

42:17.072 --> 42:18.211
Could this be...

42:18.541 --> 42:20.242
a self-fabricated scenario by An Tae Ho?

42:20.541 --> 42:21.842
Couldn't it be a show...

42:21.842 --> 42:24.512
so he can pretend to be dead and live a whole new life somewhere?

42:27.882 --> 42:28.952
But then...

42:29.621 --> 42:30.921
look at his face.

42:31.492 --> 42:32.652
Could this be fabricated?

42:38.291 --> 42:39.961
I wish it actually was a show.

42:42.132 --> 42:43.831
- Eun Ki.
- You're watching it, right?

42:44.402 --> 42:46.001
All the jurors got the message.

42:49.141 --> 42:51.572
- All of you got it?
- Yes.

43:00.351 --> 43:02.322
Hey. What do we do?

43:05.021 --> 43:06.191
Darn it.

43:07.921 --> 43:08.921
- Captain.
- Yes?

43:08.921 --> 43:10.932
- I've located the IP address.
- Really? Where?

43:10.932 --> 43:12.162
It's an Internet cafe downtown.

43:12.291 --> 43:13.561
- Head over there now.
- Yes, sir.

43:29.441 --> 43:30.711
Hello.

43:30.751 --> 43:32.811
Hello. Police.

43:32.912 --> 43:34.021
Oh, I see.

43:34.121 --> 43:36.682
Which computer belongs to this IP address?

43:37.552 --> 43:38.751
Just a second.

43:39.251 --> 43:40.762
- It's number 52.
- Where...

43:40.762 --> 43:42.162
- It's over there.
- Number 52...

43:55.501 --> 43:57.972
Since when was that seat vacant?

43:58.112 --> 43:59.612
It's been vacant all day.

44:48.322 --> 44:50.322
We have no way of figuring out where this could be.

44:50.322 --> 44:52.532
Is this above-ground or a basement? Is he in the city or not?

44:53.032 --> 44:54.932
How are we supposed to save An Tae Ho?

44:55.362 --> 44:58.731
Can't we catch the killer by tracing the IP address?

44:58.731 --> 45:00.472
To the killer, this is like a game.

45:00.572 --> 45:01.641
A game? What do you mean?

45:02.541 --> 45:05.012
The fact that he sent this video...

45:05.171 --> 45:07.342
shows that he feels confident he will win this game.

45:08.782 --> 45:12.012
I bet he already knows that the police are tracking his IP address.

45:12.612 --> 45:14.052
I'm sure he diverted his IP address.

45:15.682 --> 45:18.322
Darn it, this scumbag...

45:23.762 --> 45:24.862
Hold on.

45:26.961 --> 45:28.501
Do you hear that?

45:41.541 --> 45:43.541
It's some kind of bell.

45:43.541 --> 45:44.851
I think it's a clock bell.

45:50.322 --> 45:51.822
It sounds familiar.

46:03.601 --> 46:04.771
It sounds the same.

46:07.441 --> 46:09.472
Manager An is at Mr. Choi's place now.

46:09.472 --> 46:10.501
Wait.

46:11.441 --> 46:14.081
How can you be so sure that he's at Mr. Choi's place?

46:14.311 --> 46:16.342
The exact same wall clocks can be found all over the country.

46:16.342 --> 46:18.282
You heard that too. It sounds exactly the same.

46:18.282 --> 46:19.912
We're only speculating here.

46:20.081 --> 46:22.751
I'll go there and find out whether I'm right or not.

46:24.121 --> 46:25.452
It's a waste of time.

46:25.452 --> 46:27.492
An Tae Ho will die if you keep barking up the wrong tree.

46:27.492 --> 46:29.862
Don't you think we're wasting time by arguing like this?

46:56.322 --> 46:58.092
This could be dangerous, Eun Ki. Just stay here.

46:58.092 --> 46:59.322
No, I'm coming with you.

47:03.021 --> 47:04.691
- Be careful.
- You too.

47:19.441 --> 47:20.541
An Tae Ho.

48:26.211 --> 48:28.182
We picked up a signal from An Tae Ho's phone again.

48:28.182 --> 48:29.182
Darn it.

48:29.441 --> 48:32.052
- Hey, are you sure it's here?
- Pardon me?

48:32.851 --> 48:35.182
- Did we come to the right place?
- Sorry?

48:35.182 --> 48:36.652
That little...

48:44.932 --> 48:46.032
Do you hear that?

48:46.762 --> 48:47.902
Where is it?

48:48.202 --> 48:49.932
Where is the sound coming from?

48:50.501 --> 48:52.501
- It's this way.
- It's here.

48:53.902 --> 48:55.541
- Where is it?
- Wait! Hold on.

48:56.072 --> 48:57.941
- Where is it?
- Hold on.

48:58.871 --> 49:00.171
Goodness. Go away.

49:51.143 --> 49:52.342
What happened?

49:58.683 --> 50:01.083
Manager An probably doesn't know that we're watching him, right?

50:06.753 --> 50:08.293
I think he's trying to say something.

50:13.222 --> 50:15.492
Yes, An Tae Ho. Where are you?

50:15.793 --> 50:17.433
Tell us, please.

50:19.532 --> 50:20.603
Yoon Jae.

50:28.773 --> 50:30.543
That day, 20 years ago...

50:32.583 --> 50:34.583
Yes, it was me.

50:36.753 --> 50:39.882
I was the one who told Crazy Dog about our plan to escape.

50:42.922 --> 50:44.922
I thought about telling you guys the truth...

50:44.922 --> 50:47.762
I debated, time and time again.

50:47.762 --> 50:49.692
But I couldn't bring myself to do it.

50:50.632 --> 50:51.833
At the time,

50:53.163 --> 50:56.233
all I could think was that I had to get out of that misery.

50:57.902 --> 51:00.942
I really didn't know Number 24 would die.

51:00.942 --> 51:02.112
I swear, I didn't know.

51:07.853 --> 51:10.152
Since then, there hasn't been a single day...

51:11.282 --> 51:13.322
when I could sleep peacefully.

51:13.753 --> 51:16.992
The moment I close my eyes, I see Number 24's face.

51:18.023 --> 51:20.893
No matter how hard I try to run, I can never get away from it.

51:23.793 --> 51:26.132
I suppose it's time to put myself out of this misery.

51:30.172 --> 51:31.503
I'm really happy...

51:32.873 --> 51:35.543
I got to see you again before I breathed my last.

51:36.572 --> 51:37.842
There was something...

51:38.983 --> 51:41.512
I really wanted to tell you if I ever met you again.

51:45.123 --> 51:46.282
I'm sorry.

51:46.552 --> 51:49.222
I'm sorry, Yoon Jae.

51:52.722 --> 51:55.592
Number 11, 12,

51:56.592 --> 51:57.793
and 24...

51:58.762 --> 52:01.733
I owe you all an apology. I'm really sorry.

52:06.472 --> 52:07.572
And...

52:10.512 --> 52:11.643
I really hope...

52:12.313 --> 52:14.953
I'm the last one.

52:17.112 --> 52:19.552
You must stop, Yoon Jae.

52:30.893 --> 52:31.902
An Tae Ho.

52:36.902 --> 52:39.503
We only have three hours left now.

52:57.853 --> 52:58.922
Ma'am.

52:58.922 --> 53:01.433
Everything you said at the wedding was very accurate.

53:01.793 --> 53:05.362
Look. Do you think you can figure out where he is?

53:06.302 --> 53:07.972
If I knew that,

53:08.302 --> 53:10.603
I wouldn't be drinking here now.

53:12.003 --> 53:15.112
Your karma decides when and how you will die.

53:17.373 --> 53:18.512
Oh, boy.

53:34.563 --> 53:35.663
What?

53:35.692 --> 53:37.132
That wall...

53:38.933 --> 53:40.103
What is it?

53:40.802 --> 53:41.902
That wall.

53:42.132 --> 53:44.433
The walls were covered with blackout curtains.

53:46.672 --> 53:49.342
Something's written on the wall.

53:49.672 --> 53:50.842
Let me zoom in.

53:52.413 --> 53:54.413
(Someone's in here.)

53:54.413 --> 53:57.612
"Someone's in here?"

54:02.953 --> 54:04.052
This is...

54:05.023 --> 54:06.762
It says, "11, 12, 13. Help us."

54:08.032 --> 54:09.692
What? "11, 12, 13?"

54:10.762 --> 54:12.503
I've seen this before.

54:13.362 --> 54:14.603
This? Where?

54:16.273 --> 54:17.902
I swear, I've seen it before.

55:30.972 --> 55:32.183
I don't have time to explain.

55:32.913 --> 55:34.683
Tell me where you met me before you brought me home.

55:34.683 --> 55:35.882
What?

55:35.882 --> 55:36.983
What are you talking about?

55:36.983 --> 55:38.123
I know everything.

55:38.922 --> 55:40.152

55:47.492 --> 55:48.762
I don't have time. Tell me now!

Someone is on the verge of death in that place now.

55:54.733 --> 55:57.132
Where was it? You have to tell me now!

Someone is dying?

55:59.342 --> 56:00.603
Who?

56:08.282 --> 56:09.853
- Hi.
- I found out...

56:09.853 --> 56:11.353
where Manager An was 20 years ago.

56:11.623 --> 56:12.753
Where?

56:12.822 --> 56:15.552
An orphanage in Sosan-myeon, Seosan-gu.

56:15.822 --> 56:18.192
But I can't call them because there's no phone number.

56:18.563 --> 56:22.692
I see that he lived there from 2000 to 2002,

56:22.762 --> 56:24.032
so this must be the place.

56:24.092 --> 56:26.762

58:54.342 --> 58:56.052
Pick up, Sung Jun.

01:00:27.703 --> 01:00:28.873
Stop.

01:00:30.213 --> 01:00:31.242
Get back here.

01:00:41.023 --> 01:00:44.052
Where is he? You scumbag...

01:01:02.612 --> 01:01:03.873
You psycho...

01:01:07.342 --> 01:01:08.552
Stop.

01:01:40.683 --> 01:01:42.083
(Our priority is to protect child actors...)

01:01:42.083 --> 01:01:43.483
(and animals and the dangerous scenes...)

01:01:43.483 --> 01:01:44.753
(were not shot with real children or animals...)

01:01:44.753 --> 01:01:45.983
(but with doubles and dummies.)

01:02:08.172 --> 01:02:11.983
(Blind)

01:02:12.213 --> 01:02:15.983
Hope Welfare Center was where everything began.

01:02:16.183 --> 01:02:18.583
All the kids who were there...

01:02:18.983 --> 01:02:20.052
Get rid of him.

01:02:21.853 --> 01:02:23.052
- Get a taste of it.
- Sung Hoon!

01:02:23.052 --> 01:02:24.893
The pain of losing your family!

01:02:25.692 --> 01:02:28.222
You think Detective Ryu was behind Manager An's case too?

01:02:28.393 --> 01:02:30.532
I thought we were a team.

01:02:30.532 --> 01:02:32.063
What is he hiding?

01:02:32.663 --> 01:02:34.463
Why did the serial killings occur?

01:02:34.963 --> 01:02:35.972
We've got a problem.

01:02:35.972 --> 01:02:37.733
And the truth behind the real killer.

01:02:41.039 --> 01:02:46.613
