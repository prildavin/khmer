(Ha Seok Jin)

00:30.422 --> 00:31.568
(Jeong Eun Ji)

00:42.090 --> 00:43.629
(This drama is fiction and people, places, organizations,)

00:43.629 --> 00:45.330
(incidents, groups, and settings...)

00:45.330 --> 00:46.929
(are not based on reality.)

01:53.933 --> 01:55.092
Goodness.

02:02.273 --> 02:03.341
Who are you?

02:03.342 --> 02:04.803
I'm a producer at a broadcasting station.

02:05.103 --> 02:08.012
I received a tip that children are dying at Hope Welfare Center.

02:08.013 --> 02:09.082
Yoon Jae, stop.

02:10.482 --> 02:11.642
Who are you?

02:23.362 --> 02:25.232
Are you really a producer?

02:26.493 --> 02:28.803
- Can I see your ID?
- Sure.

02:32.232 --> 02:33.232
Here.

02:42.442 --> 02:45.252
I'm filming this in secret, so the staff doesn't know.

02:45.512 --> 02:48.083
Do you guys live in this welfare center?

02:48.352 --> 02:49.782
Why are you locked in here?

02:49.852 --> 02:51.482
What did you do wrong?

02:51.483 --> 02:53.023
You should ask one question at a time.

02:53.292 --> 02:55.923
Oh, right. I'm sorry.

02:56.123 --> 02:57.493
I was in a rush.

02:57.792 --> 02:58.993
If I tell you everything,

03:00.233 --> 03:01.463
what will you do?

03:01.493 --> 03:04.632
I have to tell the world and save you guys from here.

03:08.803 --> 03:10.403
Then save him first.

03:21.713 --> 03:22.882
No way.

03:23.623 --> 03:25.322
He got caught trying to run away.

03:26.292 --> 03:28.252
If he doesn't get treatment soon, he's going to die.

03:35.662 --> 03:36.733
Those jerks.

03:51.483 --> 03:56.751
(Episode 9: Square One)

03:56.752 --> 04:01.192
(There are people in here. Please save 11, 12, and 13.)

04:10.363 --> 04:11.863
Number seven, An Tae Ho.

04:12.673 --> 04:14.232
(24 hours ago)

04:14.233 --> 04:15.842
You betrayed us.

04:16.971 --> 04:18.942
This is why you must die.

04:21.983 --> 04:24.012
But you don't have to be in despair already.

04:24.483 --> 04:25.713
I'm planning...

04:26.483 --> 04:28.683
on giving you a chance.

04:33.322 --> 04:34.453
This machine...

04:35.153 --> 04:37.863
is set up to pull up the rope every hour.

04:39.393 --> 04:43.963
After 24 hours, your feet will be dangling in the air.

04:48.173 --> 04:51.243
But if someone comes to save you in that time,

04:51.743 --> 04:53.673
you'll be able to leave here alive.

04:54.772 --> 04:56.082
What do you think will happen?

04:56.942 --> 04:58.543
Do you think people will come to save you?

04:59.212 --> 05:02.082
Or will they turn a blind eye?

05:19.632 --> 05:22.442
I really don't have much time left.

05:24.272 --> 05:26.072
Now that I'm about to die,

05:29.212 --> 05:31.613
I'm reminded of the moments we were together here.

05:34.012 --> 05:36.322
Do you remember how we hid from Crazy Dog...

05:36.952 --> 05:39.652
and had a water fight in the showers?

05:41.593 --> 05:43.223
The reason why...

05:44.022 --> 05:46.462
I was able to endure each day in that nightmare...

05:47.632 --> 05:52.873
was because I spent that time with all of you.

05:53.933 --> 05:56.103
We came up with a plan to escape together,

05:56.543 --> 06:00.173
and we talked about the food we wanted to eat once we got out.

06:01.812 --> 06:04.343
If I didn't make that decision,

06:06.413 --> 06:09.053
we might still be living like that.

06:12.123 --> 06:14.522
Even in our 40s and 50s,

06:16.863 --> 06:19.062
we would rely on each other like back in the day.

06:30.642 --> 06:31.702
I'm sorry...

06:32.843 --> 06:35.072
that this is all I could do.

06:35.743 --> 06:36.882
I'm really sorry.

07:09.743 --> 07:12.113
An Tae Ho! No!

07:14.382 --> 07:15.752
Wake up, An Tae Ho!

07:19.452 --> 07:20.452
An Tae Ho!

07:26.332 --> 07:27.363
Come on!

07:35.233 --> 07:36.303
Sung Hoon.

07:37.072 --> 07:38.202
An Tae Ho!

07:39.772 --> 07:40.812
Sung Hoon.

07:41.373 --> 07:43.243
- Sung Jun.
- An Tae Ho!

08:38.202 --> 08:39.272
Sung Jun.

08:48.613 --> 08:50.442
An Tae Ho. Wake up.

08:54.952 --> 08:55.983
Stop.

08:56.783 --> 08:57.952
It's too late.

08:58.993 --> 09:00.953
I can save him.

09:01.752 --> 09:02.863
Wake up.

09:04.762 --> 09:06.762
- Sung Jun.
- I can do it.

09:06.993 --> 09:08.932
- Darn it!
- Stop!

09:14.833 --> 09:16.873
An Tae Ho chose this himself.

09:23.282 --> 09:24.613
An Tae Ho chose...

09:27.353 --> 09:28.782
to punish himself.

09:31.823 --> 09:33.022
So stop.

09:34.823 --> 09:35.922
Let him go.

09:47.073 --> 09:48.332
(Caller ID Restricted)

09:48.333 --> 09:50.573
("Save Me" Big event is now over!)

10:02.353 --> 10:03.382
Sung Jun.

10:04.052 --> 10:05.123
Ryu Sung Jun!

10:21.402 --> 10:22.443
Sung Jun!

10:31.412 --> 10:32.752
We finally found you.

10:36.182 --> 10:37.182
Get him.

11:22.603 --> 11:27.002
It would've been nice if you had died the last time we caught you.

11:27.532 --> 11:28.772
What do you think you're doing?

11:29.103 --> 11:31.842
If you hurt my brother, I will kill you.

11:31.843 --> 11:33.072
I will kill you!

11:33.073 --> 11:34.473
If you wanted to save your brother,

11:34.642 --> 11:36.613
you shouldn't have killed my daughter.

11:37.483 --> 11:40.882
You should feel the pain of seeing your family die too.

12:00.402 --> 12:01.473
Moon Kang!

12:02.103 --> 12:03.142
Go.

12:11.343 --> 12:13.411
- Round them up!
- What is this?

12:13.412 --> 12:15.212
Hurry up!

12:15.213 --> 12:17.382
- Hands in the air!
- Freeze!

12:17.552 --> 12:19.722
- Don't move!
- Hands in the air!

12:19.723 --> 12:21.852
- Freeze!
- What?

12:21.853 --> 12:24.063
- Get them.
- Go!

12:24.922 --> 12:27.792
- Darn it!
- Freeze!

12:28.162 --> 12:29.733
- Hey!
- Stop!

12:43.583 --> 12:44.682
(Detective)

13:28.593 --> 13:32.162
(Violent Crimes Team 4)

13:34.662 --> 13:36.963
- Seok Gu, what happened?
- You're here.

13:37.233 --> 13:38.762
Is Detective Ryu okay?

13:43.343 --> 13:44.443
Is this your girlfriend?

13:48.343 --> 13:49.613
You've got to be joking.

13:54.882 --> 13:56.421
The situation is not good.

13:56.422 --> 13:58.882
He was arrested at the scene where An Tae Ho's body was found.

13:59.623 --> 14:02.252
Does the police suspect Detective Ryu in Manager An's case too?

14:03.123 --> 14:06.132
Detective Ryu went there to save Manager An.

14:06.363 --> 14:07.832
I can attest to that.

14:07.833 --> 14:11.203
But then the fact that you hid him all this time would be revealed.

14:11.363 --> 14:14.333
- Would that be okay?
- That doesn't matter. I'll testify.

14:16.402 --> 14:19.373
No. I don't think Sung Jun would want that.

14:20.873 --> 14:23.612
Then what about Judge Ryu? He must've gone there too.

14:23.613 --> 14:25.213
Didn't you meet him there?

14:26.113 --> 14:28.912
We did meet him, but the thing is...

14:59.412 --> 15:01.382
That jerk must be the culprit.

15:07.323 --> 15:08.922
Why the big sigh?

15:12.323 --> 15:14.693
Detective Kang. How is my brother?

15:15.333 --> 15:18.363
He almost died because of Mr. Baek and his men.

15:18.833 --> 15:20.333
My brother is okay, right?

15:21.772 --> 15:23.843
What a touching display of brotherly love.

15:24.603 --> 15:26.943
You're this worried about your brother,

15:28.943 --> 15:30.083
but your brother is...

15:32.412 --> 15:34.483
- What does that mean?
- Ryu Sung Jun.

15:35.182 --> 15:37.352
How do you think we knew...

15:37.353 --> 15:38.983
that you were at Hope Welfare Center?

15:44.223 --> 15:46.532
(Statement)

15:51.432 --> 15:53.772
Can you tell us why you reported it?

15:54.802 --> 15:59.142
Is there any other reason for wanting to know the truth?

16:04.343 --> 16:05.813
What truth do you mean?

16:07.052 --> 16:08.953
Why a serial murder happened...

16:09.282 --> 16:12.953
and who the culprit is. That's what I mean.

16:26.833 --> 16:27.932
Step outside.

16:28.103 --> 16:30.602
Don't let anyone in until I call you.

16:30.603 --> 16:31.672
Yes, sir.

16:41.182 --> 16:42.682
Good going.

16:43.083 --> 16:45.723
You should've run for it before the cops got there.

16:45.953 --> 16:47.752
What do you think you're doing, getting dragged in here like this?

16:49.993 --> 16:52.363
You must not know me very well, Chief.

16:52.693 --> 16:55.963
I didn't come in here because I didn't know how to run.

16:57.502 --> 16:58.703
Then what?

16:59.132 --> 17:00.902
Do you mean you came in here on purpose?

17:14.213 --> 17:15.281
Have you lost your mind?

17:16.152 --> 17:17.223
Don't you know where we are?

17:17.922 --> 17:19.593
Don't do anything stupid.

17:21.521 --> 17:22.593
Chief.

17:22.823 --> 17:25.762
Just because I bowed to you, do you think you're above me?

17:26.432 --> 17:29.563
The flowers on your shoulder mean nothing to me.

17:31.103 --> 17:34.202
You just have to do as I say from now on.

17:34.632 --> 17:35.702
Do you understand?

17:45.313 --> 17:46.382
(Doing our best, Muyeong Police)

17:48.083 --> 17:49.113
Judge Ryu.

17:51.583 --> 17:52.652
Let's talk.

17:54.023 --> 17:55.053
Later.

17:57.063 --> 17:58.323
I'd rather we talk now.

18:01.033 --> 18:04.063
I was told you reported Detective Ryu.

18:05.033 --> 18:06.103
Why?

18:06.873 --> 18:08.402
Did you have to go and do that?

18:08.503 --> 18:10.803
Why should I explain that to you?

18:16.642 --> 18:18.912
Oh. I get it.

18:19.583 --> 18:21.412
It was my wishful thinking.

18:21.783 --> 18:23.823
I thought we were a team.

18:25.652 --> 18:28.293
If you don't want to explain, don't.

18:28.523 --> 18:31.263
But I need to speak my mind.

18:32.363 --> 18:35.263
Did you ever stop to think how Detective Ryu must feel?

18:36.033 --> 18:39.533
How it must feel to be betrayed by the brother he trusted?

18:42.003 --> 18:43.142
You'd never get it.

18:44.043 --> 18:46.513
Because all you care about are law and principles.

18:53.982 --> 18:56.053
(Muyeong Police, Doing our best for the safety of our residents)

19:52.773 --> 19:54.212
Are you here about Sung Jun?

19:54.242 --> 19:55.273
I'll try to...

19:56.882 --> 19:58.182
You said you'd handle it.

19:58.482 --> 19:59.982
Is this you handling it?

20:01.682 --> 20:03.452
I had no choice this time.

20:04.222 --> 20:05.553
You had no choice?

20:06.392 --> 20:10.191
I trusted you and spoke to the media, the whole nation.

20:10.192 --> 20:12.722
And... And what?

20:13.662 --> 20:15.563
You should calm down.

20:15.662 --> 20:17.532
Let's hear what Sung Hoon has to say.

20:17.533 --> 20:19.603
Okay, then. Speak up.

20:20.073 --> 20:22.172
What could you not handle...

20:22.202 --> 20:25.142
that got Sung Jun ended up in a cell?

20:25.242 --> 20:28.273
If I hadn't called the police, both Sung Jun and I...

20:28.573 --> 20:30.283
would've died at Baek Moon Kang's hand.

20:31.942 --> 20:33.182
Who is Baek Moon Kang?

20:34.513 --> 20:35.882
Do you not know, Mother?

20:39.323 --> 20:41.253
How would I know someone like that?

20:51.432 --> 20:52.701
Baek Moon Kang was the head of security...

20:52.702 --> 20:53.972
at Hope Welfare Center.

20:55.103 --> 20:57.873
His daughter is the victim of the Joker Murder.

21:05.142 --> 21:08.783
Baek Moon Kang believes Sung Jun killed his daughter.

21:09.253 --> 21:11.482
I think he followed me to get to Sung Jun.

21:11.753 --> 21:14.853
By the time I'd noticed, it was too late.

21:16.692 --> 21:17.793
The police station...

21:19.063 --> 21:20.462
is the safest place?

21:21.763 --> 21:23.961
Okay. You're not entirely wrong...

21:23.962 --> 21:25.563
But I was wrong.

21:26.972 --> 21:29.773
Sung Jun's locked up with Baek Moon Kang.

21:31.742 --> 21:32.742
In the same station.

21:33.472 --> 21:34.472
What?

21:53.492 --> 21:54.563
You asked to see me?

21:55.093 --> 21:57.103
Yes. What did Yoon Jae say?

21:58.333 --> 22:00.303
Who is "Yoon Jae"?

22:03.003 --> 22:05.003
Did I say "Yoon Jae"?

22:06.712 --> 22:09.273
I was thinking of something else and my tongue slipped.

22:13.952 --> 22:15.352
Did Sung Jun confess?

22:15.353 --> 22:18.152
No. As we thought, he denied everything.

22:18.753 --> 22:22.123
Okay. Then pretend to investigate him,

22:22.892 --> 22:26.892
and when you get the chance, take him to Baek Moon Kang.

22:27.432 --> 22:28.533
Do you know what I mean?

22:28.593 --> 22:30.002
Yes, sir.

22:30.003 --> 22:31.962
What's important is what happens next.

22:33.533 --> 22:35.972
Once Baek Moon Kang takes care of Sung Jun,

22:37.043 --> 22:38.242
you have to take out...

22:39.972 --> 22:41.013
Baek Moon Kang.

22:43.442 --> 22:45.642
Chief. Are you telling me...

22:47.513 --> 22:49.553
to murder someone?

22:51.823 --> 22:53.492
Why are you so surprised?

22:53.952 --> 22:55.793
It won't be your first time.

23:03.803 --> 23:04.833
Hello, it's me.

23:05.662 --> 23:06.702
It's done.

23:07.273 --> 23:09.672
Mr. Baek's people took Sung Jun.

23:10.202 --> 23:11.603
Live rounds were fired,

23:11.902 --> 23:13.873
so they won't think we lost him on purpose.

23:15.043 --> 23:18.583
I'll report Sung Jun killed Jung Man Chun's wife and son...

23:23.722 --> 23:26.283
No. There isn't a problem.

23:27.553 --> 23:28.593
Yes, sir.

23:35.293 --> 23:36.333
Shoot.

24:08.132 --> 24:09.932
Hush. Be quiet.

24:10.333 --> 24:11.333
Be quiet!

24:34.192 --> 24:36.692
Even if I take it down to negligent manslaughter...

24:36.863 --> 24:39.421
and you end up with a criminal record with no connections,

24:39.422 --> 24:40.833
do you think you can recover?

24:43.702 --> 24:46.603
To the rich and powerful, a mistake is a memory to look back on.

24:47.533 --> 24:50.503
To those with nothing, a mistake equals a crash.

24:52.073 --> 24:54.013
It will end your life.

Ms. Jo!

25:27.472 --> 25:28.873
Don't hurt yourself.

25:49.363 --> 25:50.932
I wonder if he ate.

25:58.043 --> 25:59.043
Who?

26:03.043 --> 26:05.542
A uniform? Did you go to school?

26:05.543 --> 26:07.652
You told me to sit the exam, so I did.

26:10.152 --> 26:12.382
All the writing sounded foreign to me.

26:13.083 --> 26:14.523
You literally just sat through it.

26:15.353 --> 26:16.662
Good for you, though.

26:20.462 --> 26:22.063
The detective guy got caught?

26:22.662 --> 26:23.732
Yes.

26:28.972 --> 26:30.773
When will the judge come by?

26:30.942 --> 26:32.873
He has no reason to anymore.

26:33.843 --> 26:36.573
What? You can't say that.

26:37.513 --> 26:39.182
You called him my mentor.

26:39.442 --> 26:41.753
Call him over now. I have more exams tomorrow.

26:43.853 --> 26:46.793
A mentor's not a private tutor that helps you cram the day before.

26:50.422 --> 26:51.863
What's his number?

26:53.293 --> 26:55.392
No, I should just go and see him.

26:56.863 --> 26:59.263
He works at Muyeong Local Court, right?

27:03.343 --> 27:06.671

27:06.672 --> 27:08.043
It's close by.

27:10.642 --> 27:13.142
Why are you so interested in Judge Ryu?

27:15.313 --> 27:16.412
It's fun.

27:26.523 --> 27:29.692
He looks like he has a lot of secrets.

27:49.182 --> 27:50.482
Sung Jun...

27:51.753 --> 27:54.152
is your one and only brother.

27:56.962 --> 27:58.192
Can you...

27:59.363 --> 28:00.962
get him out?

28:50.613 --> 28:51.942
About my chief...

28:53.283 --> 28:55.613
What's the real reason why he wants me to kill Ryu Sung Jun?

29:01.053 --> 29:02.952
You're the only one who will suffer if you stay loyal.

29:08.992 --> 29:12.103
I'll make sure to save you without letting him know.

Did my brother's interrogation end well?

- No...

34:37.382 --> 34:38.553
Where's Baek Moon Kang right now?

34:38.554 --> 34:40.483
Detective Kang took him to ask him some more questions.

34:41.184 --> 34:42.954
Captain Oh, we're in trouble.

34:43.454 --> 34:45.994
Detective Kang was attacked by Baek Moon Kang.

34:46.253 --> 34:48.493
What? What do you mean he was attacked?

34:48.494 --> 34:50.533
Well... It was in the bathroom...

34:50.534 --> 34:52.833
Darn it. Hurry up.

34:54.503 --> 34:55.563
Wait.

34:57.503 --> 34:58.933
Where's Sung Jun?

34:58.934 --> 35:00.573
He's in the interrogation room...

35:43.543 --> 35:45.083

- Detective Ryu!
- Detective Ryu!

Wait.

37:14.073 --> 37:15.543
Don't worry about things here.

37:16.644 --> 37:18.213
Just get some rest for a few days.

37:20.613 --> 37:21.744
Oh, by the way.

37:22.943 --> 37:24.054
That evidence...

37:26.253 --> 37:27.624
Your brother brought it in.

37:28.624 --> 37:30.923
He found it within a few hours of turning you in.

Well, I'm just letting you know.

I'm home.

38:05.454 --> 38:06.523

38:07.593 --> 38:08.693
Sit if you're going to eat.

38:12.164 --> 38:14.503
Do you not want any? If not, I'll eat it by myself.

Wait. I'll eat.

By the way,

how did you find it?

Captain Oh told me.

39:10.793 --> 39:12.193
The timing was perfect, wasn't it?

39:12.894 --> 39:14.093
You got lucky.

39:20.593 --> 39:21.903
So what if I'm lucky?

39:22.564 --> 39:24.773
You almost died because of me.

39:28.043 --> 39:31.573
I dragged you into this mess just so I could live,

39:32.673 --> 39:36.784
and you ended up getting hurt by that piece of trash, Baek Moon Kang.

39:41.084 --> 39:42.323
This will never happen again.

39:44.793 --> 39:46.753
I will never drag you into my mess again.

39:47.764 --> 39:50.463
So you can stop caring about my affairs too.

40:18.494 --> 40:20.963
Actually, Director, the reason I called today is...

40:21.164 --> 40:22.763
Would you happen to know anyone...

40:22.764 --> 40:24.894
who has information on Hope Welfare Center?

40:25.164 --> 40:28.534
I'm not sure, but I'll look around.

Yes, I'd appreciate it.

started at Hope Welfare Center.

41:02.034 --> 41:04.503
Did you remember anything else when you were there this time?

41:06.633 --> 41:08.903
It's all a mess.

41:10.173 --> 41:11.244
I'm not sure.

41:11.343 --> 41:15.343
Could it be you're instinctively trying not to remember?

41:16.644 --> 41:19.184
As I saw Manager An's last moments,

41:19.713 --> 41:23.923
I somehow thought that might be the case.

41:28.494 --> 41:29.764
Hope Welfare Center...

41:31.193 --> 41:32.962
What on earth happened there...

41:32.963 --> 41:35.204

41:41.543 --> 41:42.843
How do you think they're doing now?

42:39.494 --> 42:41.863
has been cleared of all charges.

We sincerely apologize to Detective Ryu and his family,

43:06.323 --> 43:07.323
(Jung and Baek's relationship)

43:07.324 --> 43:10.922
We have arrested Baek Moon Kang for the murder of Jung Man Chun...

43:10.923 --> 43:13.693
by pushing him off of the hospital roof on April 22,

43:14.034 --> 43:18.104
and also for the murders of his wife and son...

43:18.334 --> 43:20.474
who were staying in a motel.

43:21.073 --> 43:24.744
Next, I will describe Baek Moon Kang's crime methods.

43:25.113 --> 43:26.474
The suspect, Baek Moon Kang,

43:27.073 --> 43:29.413
killed Jung Man Chun's wife and son at the motel,

43:29.414 --> 43:32.314
then went to the hospital to kill Jung Man Chun.

43:32.814 --> 43:34.683
The button found at the scene, which belonged to...

43:34.684 --> 43:36.454
Detective Ryu Sung Jun,

43:36.624 --> 43:41.092
was confirmed to have been taken by the suspect's subordinate.

43:41.093 --> 43:42.093
(Security footage from outside the motel)

43:42.094 --> 43:46.394
Also, he seriously injured a police officer who was watching him,

43:46.463 --> 43:47.963
making him lose consciousness.

43:48.363 --> 43:50.632
And he testified that...

43:50.633 --> 43:54.273
he used the fact that Ryu had been there and attempted to frame him.

(The assailant, Baek)

44:03.814 --> 44:05.653
(Mother)

44:08.483 --> 44:09.553
Yes, Mother.

44:09.554 --> 44:12.494
Son. You did well.

44:14.193 --> 44:15.293
There's no need for that.

44:16.193 --> 44:19.564
I only did what I had to do.

44:33.744 --> 44:37.814
He will be buried at an arboretum near the unwed mothers' shelter.

44:38.713 --> 44:40.314
I went there and saw the place too.

44:40.354 --> 44:43.054
The view is great, so I'm sure Manager An will like it.

44:44.854 --> 44:46.153
I'll leave it to the two of you.

44:46.394 --> 44:49.193
I wish I could help, but I'm not well enough.

44:50.293 --> 44:51.494
Are you ill?

44:51.834 --> 44:54.534
No, I just saw the news that the culprit had been caught.

44:54.903 --> 44:57.104

44:57.434 --> 44:58.704

45:00.633 --> 45:02.572
Actually, I always woke up around 3am every night...

45:02.573 --> 45:04.204
because of some stomach issues.

45:04.443 --> 45:05.543
But today,

45:06.343 --> 45:09.414
I was rolling on the floor. Gosh, I feel like I almost died.

45:09.843 --> 45:11.153
Should I get you some medicine?

45:12.253 --> 45:14.983
It's fine. I'm sure it'll get better with time.

45:20.153 --> 45:22.224
They say Detective Ryu Sung Jun has been caught.

45:24.394 --> 45:27.293
I'm only saying this now,

45:27.394 --> 45:29.534
but I met the culprit when he was young.

45:32.003 --> 45:34.673
Who knew that it would turn out to be Ryu Sung Jun?

45:42.343 --> 45:43.343
Why?

45:46.084 --> 45:49.523
Gosh, why are you all looking at me like that?

45:50.454 --> 45:51.793
You fool.

45:52.323 --> 45:54.664

Bye.

46:55.823 --> 46:57.383
I'm sorry about the other day.

It's cracked, probably because I'm tired.

47:43.534 --> 47:45.534
- I'll get going, then.
- Okay.

So he struggled to get to where he is now.

52:15.983 --> 52:17.652
Is that why he has a lot to hide?

52:21.623 --> 52:22.962
What do you mean?

52:26.833 --> 52:30.933
The person Mr. Baek has been talking to most frequently these days...

52:31.532 --> 52:33.072
is Chief Yeom.

52:34.402 --> 52:37.842
They spoke very often on the phone. They can't just be acquaintances.

52:38.913 --> 52:40.512
They must be really close.

52:42.643 --> 52:44.183
What is it...

52:45.083 --> 52:46.782
that Chief Yeom is hiding?

53:04.703 --> 53:05.733
Hey!

53:06.373 --> 53:09.171
Where is Chief Yeom? Tell him to come out!

53:09.172 --> 53:11.102
- Captain, please.
- Darn it!

53:11.103 --> 53:13.543
Hey, Chief Yeom! Darn you...

53:14.273 --> 53:16.942
Hey, where is Chief Yeom?

53:17.242 --> 53:19.253
Where is he? Gosh.

53:19.413 --> 53:20.711
What's with Captain Oh?

53:20.712 --> 53:23.222
He said he had to speak with you in person, sir.

53:23.223 --> 53:24.452
- Is that Chief Yeom?
- Yes.

53:24.453 --> 53:25.592
Oh!

53:27.723 --> 53:30.793
Chief... Chief, my foot.

53:31.123 --> 53:32.592
If you're a chief,

53:32.862 --> 53:34.901
I am the president of this country, you jerk!

53:34.902 --> 53:36.333
Have you completely lost your mind?

53:36.663 --> 53:39.172
On top of drinking while on duty,

53:39.503 --> 53:41.333
you dare to yell at your boss in a drunken frenzy!

53:41.773 --> 53:44.203
Captain Oh!

53:44.703 --> 53:47.043
I'm giving you a zero on your performance review!

53:48.043 --> 53:49.183
Hey.

53:49.643 --> 53:52.753
I don't care whether I get a zero or below zero.

53:53.512 --> 53:57.322
I'm embarrassed that a jerk like you is evaluating me.

53:57.723 --> 53:58.952
I don't want it!

53:58.953 --> 54:01.663
- You little... How dare you!
- Hey!

54:03.422 --> 54:06.163
- Stop. Hey!
- How could you...

54:06.733 --> 54:09.031
- How could you do such a thing?
- Hey, get him off me!

54:09.032 --> 54:11.261
- Why do you even live?
- Hey!

54:11.262 --> 54:12.502
- Captain, that's enough.
- You punk!

54:12.503 --> 54:15.542
- You're despicable!
- Goodness.

54:15.543 --> 54:16.741
How...

54:16.742 --> 54:20.313
You call yourself a chief?

54:21.512 --> 54:23.012
- Gosh.
- How...

54:23.143 --> 54:26.612
How could you...

54:27.583 --> 54:29.052
That idiot.

54:41.233 --> 54:42.233
(Recents)

54:43.433 --> 54:45.502
(Mr. Baek, Min Ho, Mr. Baek)

54:45.503 --> 54:47.472
(Min Ho's babysitter, Detective Kang Chang Wook, Mr. Baek)

54:47.473 --> 54:48.703
Mr. Baek...

54:52.543 --> 54:54.273
(Messages)

54:56.183 --> 54:57.542
(Detective Kang Chang Wook: Yes, sir.)

54:57.543 --> 55:00.482
(My daughter Hye Jin, Video)

55:00.483 --> 55:01.511
(April 19)

55:01.512 --> 55:02.623
April 19?

55:04.552 --> 55:06.623
But Yeom Hye Jin died on April 15.

55:08.362 --> 55:09.393
Open it.

55:09.862 --> 55:11.023
(My daughter Hye Jin, Video)

55:11.692 --> 55:12.733
What is this?

55:17.402 --> 55:19.532
Why are you doing this to me?

55:20.873 --> 55:22.273
Why am I doing this?

55:22.902 --> 55:25.543
Ask your father, Chief Yeom Ki Nam.

55:28.043 --> 55:32.712
I don't know what my father did to you,

55:33.913 --> 55:35.652
but I apologize on his behalf.

55:36.552 --> 55:38.253
Please forgive him.

55:38.822 --> 55:41.453
My son is waiting for me at home.

55:42.262 --> 55:44.362
Please don't kill me.

55:50.433 --> 55:52.933
Chief Yeom Ki Nam, are you watching this?

55:54.402 --> 55:56.172
Your daughter is begging me not to kill her.

55:59.773 --> 56:00.842
Chief Yeom.

56:02.382 --> 56:03.882
Open your eyes wide and watch.

56:07.012 --> 56:10.583
Your poor daughter has to die because of you.

58:56.552 --> 58:57.781
(Our priority is to protect child actors...)

58:57.782 --> 58:59.122
(and animals and the dangerous scenes...)

58:59.123 --> 59:00.392
(were not shot with real children or animals...)

59:00.393 --> 59:01.692
(but with doubles and dummies.)

59:21.342 --> 59:25.183
(Blind)

59:25.612 --> 59:28.183
If they're all connected to Hope Welfare Center,

59:28.822 --> 59:29.983
the killer's next target will be...

59:31.882 --> 59:36.262
You said your name was Jung Yoon Jae before you were adopted.

59:37.123 --> 59:39.462
I think that memory is false.

59:40.333 --> 59:41.833
If it's not Jung Yoon Jae, who could it be?

59:41.862 --> 59:43.663
Someone who resents you enough...

59:44.333 --> 59:46.671
to want to kill your daughter.

59:46.672 --> 59:48.003
The suspect in Kang Ha Na's murder?

59:48.572 --> 59:50.841
So far, all the victims were their family members.

59:50.842 --> 59:52.512
- My daughter, Eun Ki...
- Eun Ki!

59:53.172 --> 59:54.712
Sung Hoon. Who are you, really?

59:55.292 --> 01:00:00.875
