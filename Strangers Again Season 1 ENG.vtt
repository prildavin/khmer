As the adultery law was repealed,

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.850
I heard you can't even punish people now.

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.570
Attorney Oh, so if you...

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:25.390
take revenge by spreading rumors,

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:26.970
could you be punished for libel?

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.030
Unfortunately, that is true.

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.500
Wait, Attorney Oh.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.200
Although it's clearly a fact that adultery was committed,

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.410
you'll be found guilty of libel if you tell anyone?

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:38.430
Yes.

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.850
You'd think you wouldn't be guilty of libel

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.180
since the other person clearly committed the adultery,

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.400
but you have to be careful because a violation called

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.170
factual defamation* exists. (Defamation of character by speaking the truth.)

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.580
Isn't the law a bit ridiculous in this case?

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.060
The concerned party is very angry because of the spouse's affair.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.130
But you have to just hold it in,

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.810
regardless of how angry and frustrated you are, right?

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.140
Exactly. The unfaithful person didn't do anything right.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.250
So why does the other person have to endure everything?

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.270
Seriously. If that's the case,

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.110
then you can't do anything even if everyone commits adultery.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.480
- That's right. - Yes.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.500
People who commit adultery generally

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.640
can be identified by their ability to spew bullshit.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.370
Not even knowing their place.

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.080
The revocation of adultery law doesn't mean we should

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.160
just hold it in and look the other way.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.540
It means we can easily f*** them up in a civil court.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:27.970
F***...

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:28.950
- F*** them up? - F*** them up.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.470
- F*** them up... - Why, yes.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:32.400
How, exactly?

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.480
Against your spouse, file a divorce with maximum alimony.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.210
And file a claim for damages against the affair partner.

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.300
Whoa, it's more complicated than I thought.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.350
- Yes. - This is only the beginning.

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.840
In this process, to those two f***ers'-

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.840
To those two people's workplaces,

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.970
through several fact checks and document submission orders,

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:54.340
you can kindly let them know

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.050
what kind of litigation is happening

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.290
for what reason, in real-time.

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:02.280
Wow, if you do that you'll at least feel better.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:08.750
When you get that far, those two people will start demeaning you.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.020
Because you were a crazy person, a demon...

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.410
or a psycho, they had no choice but to have an affair.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:17.800
They'll run their mouths, speaking all this nonsense.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.820
As I said before, how do we identify those adulterous people?

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.360
Yes. They're very good at spewing bullshit.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.760
- How can you just listen to those slanderers? - Right.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.830
When you start hearing these things, you're almost at the end.

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:38.560

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:13.720
Han Do Woon and Na Soo Yeon?

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:15.680
How long has it even been since they married?

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.730
It's only been like three or four years now.

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:19.500
Gosh, what news.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.400
But why would a top star like Han Do Woon

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.300
bother to ask Attorney Oh instead of the bigger firms?

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:29.100
Could it be that all the other places rejected his case?

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:34.350
I think that is the case.

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:39.580
The issue here is quite complicated.

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:44.100
We signed a prenup agreement before getting married.

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.910
Give it to me.

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:53.720
I failed my first marriage because of the other person's affair.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.660
I'm sure you're well aware.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.080
So, this time,

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.970
[Prenuptial Agreement] I wanted to be more careful.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.500
Cut!

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.100
- Okay! - It's an okay.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:13.370
- Next scene. - Okay!

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:14.700
Prepare for the next scene!

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.680
- Preparing for the next scene! - Soo Yeon isn't here yet?

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.140
- She's here. - Soo Yeon.

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.770
- Do you know what time it is? - I'm sorry.

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:26.480
All these people are having a hard time because of you!

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.320
A rookie should know better and come-

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:31.670
My wife used to be a nameless actor before marrying me.

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:33.390
Everyone has a shot?

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:34.670
Good job, everyone!

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:36.190
Good job, everyone!

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:37.340
Good job, everyone.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:39.010
- Thank you for your work. - Okay, thank you.

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:41.250
Thank you for your work.

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:42.900
Have some meat.

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:45.640
At home, I look at actors...

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.400
I met her through work,

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.200
- and she seemed pure hearted. - You can dry it.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.100
Meow.

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:00.860
What's her name?

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.450
I don't know, either.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:06.600
You don't know the cat's name...

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.980
Then what's your name?

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.500
It's Soo Yeon. And Soo Yeon.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:18.680
Soo Yeon...

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.220
She doesn't seem to have friends.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.930
She's been alone since earlier.

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:26.820
Then shall we become her friends?

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:39.080
At first, we just started out lightly.

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:47.530
But as I continued to see her, I became certain she was the one.

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:49.330
Open your eyes.

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:53.690
Ta-da...

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:58.340
If it's her I could trust her.

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:00.600
It'll be okay to love her.

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:08.180
I felt a wave of emotions overcome me like a high tide.

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:14.530
It was warm and I was happy.

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:19.610
Although it ended because of the same reason anyway.

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:22.090
I don't have an eye for women.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.740
[The responsible spouse gives up the division of property and pays five billion won in alimony.] Na Soo Yeon...

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:29.310
had an affair, right?

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:34.380
Please get me that money.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.050
You can win, right?

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:43.700
I heard you're the goddess of litigation.

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:46.330
- Attorney Park Ha Ra? - No, it's Attorney Oh Ha Ra.

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:49.310
Oh, yes. Attorney Oh Ha Ra.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.900
Why don't I try to get it? That five billion won.

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:57.150
- Oh, no. You can't get it, can you? - Why not?

00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:59.400
Our country doesn't acknowledge prenups yet.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.570
- Unlike the US. - Oh, my.

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:03.330
Is that true?

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:04.900
There isn't precedence yet.

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:08.000
Then why did you accept? If you know you couldn't get the money.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.310
On top of that, the evidence is too vague to prove adultery.

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:14.620
That must be why all the other places turned down the case.

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:20.630
Well, it's infuriating!

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:23.750
Hearing him out, the circumstances clearly indicate an affair.

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:26.220
She suddenly goes to the countryside for a shoot and goes off the grid.

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.840
Rumors about her affair with a young actor are rampant.

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.780
Everything from her speech to her gaze has changed.

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:33.910
After gaining fame thanks to her husband, she tells him

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:37.120
he can sue her since there's no evidence to fulfill the prenuptial agreement.

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:40.080
Isn't she so shameless?

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.110
Her frenzy button's been pressed again.

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:46.620
You know, it's adultery.

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.930
Attorney Oh's frenzy button.

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:51.730
What?

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:54.670
Frenzy button?

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:55.620
Excuse me.

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:58.000
Then should we let those penniless pieces of shit,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.710
happily run off after stabbing him in the back?

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:03.300
We must make them both go bankrupt

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:07.780
and clearly show them that karma exists in this world!

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.510
Pieces of shit, penniless...

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.370
Attorney Oh, isn't that too harsh?

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:23.908
You're a star attorney, so you need to mind your language.

00:16:23.908 --> 00:16:25.840
What...

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.110
What's this?

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:29.940
Piece of shit who's...

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:31.750
Penniless...

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:33.830
A live witness of karma...

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:35.870
Aren't you Oh Ha Ra's ex-husband?

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:37.800
That's quite enough.

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.400
- Aigoo. - You did great.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.410
Oh, you're here?

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:44.760
What's the matter?

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.800
You cannot.

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:55.120
CEO Seo, how could you do this to me?

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.400
Well, the thing is-

00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:00.000
You cannot. You can't. Never!

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:04.550
You want me to work with an ex-husband who ran off after having an affair?

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:05.970
Does that even make sense?

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:11.110
We already signed the contract when we were drunk.

00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:15.790
Don't you know a legal action performed with no mental capacity is absolutely powerless?

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:19.910
For now, take a seat. Okay?

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:22.140
There are two CEOs at this firm.

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:24.900
CEO Hong and CEO Seo.

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:28.150
- It's not something you can insist- - You shut up.

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:32.200
I'll tell you clearly.

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.280
The moment he comes in, I'll be going out.

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.990
What?

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:42.960
Choose between the two of us.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:47.710
Is it me or Goo Eun Beom?

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:02.130
Goo Eun Beom is so shameless.

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:04.540
How dare he come here?

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:08.180
Well, as someone who has nowhere to go,

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:10.600
he'd be thankful CEO Seo offered a hand.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.670
Even so, to come here? Where Ha Ra is?

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:16.030
Then, should he just starve and die?

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:19.890
I heard Attorney Oh even gets the alimony payment without fail.

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:21.950
So what, huh?

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:24.700
An ex-husband who cheated should at least apologize with money.

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:27.660
I mean, he has his circumstances, too.

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:31.410
How could Attorney Oh step on his pride when she clearly knows about it?

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:33.780
Then should she welcome her cheating ex-husband,

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:37.820
by saying, "Welcome. What took you so long?"

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:40.650
Do you even have a grasp of the situation?

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:43.950
As a man myself, I wonder if he has to go that far, but

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:46.300
he has that much guts because he's a man.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.060
Gosh, you're using the wrong phrase here.

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:52.140
That's not having guts. That's having no guts.

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:56.210
Gosh, you always say, "man this" and "man that."

00:18:56.210 --> 00:19:00.120
Forget it. Why am I even talking to you?

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:04.850
I say I'm a man because I'm a man.

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:06.980
I am a man.

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:13.540
Ms. Jeon, is he the guy?

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:16.730
The one who cheated on Attorney Oh and

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:20.370
started his own legal office, the Bada-Jinjoo?

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:22.390
Bada-Jinjoo?

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:24.010
Bada means sea.

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:25.800
Jinjoo means pearl.

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:28.350
Sea-pearl*. (Sounds like "f***" in Korean)

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:29.340
That's right.

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:31.780
He is that Bada-Jinjoo.

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:33.290
According to what I heard,

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:36.670
the two of them dated for a long time before marrying.

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:40.390
- Is that true? - As far as I know for about 10 years?

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:41.890
They were a campus couple in college.

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:43.020
10 years?

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:46.440
Gosh, I don't know if I should be saying this.

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:48.930
From what I know,

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:51.890
Attorney Goo followed her around, begging her to date him.

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:53.020
Whoa...

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:54.830
How long did they live together?

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:56.040
Was it three years?

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:59.630
- I think it was even less than three years. - Daebak.

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:02.690
He even followed her around that much.

00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:04.300
He's such a bad guy.

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.990
- Hey, Ha Ra. - If you come here one more time,

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:09.520
I'll knock out all your teeth and make popcorn with them.

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.300
Get lost while I'm being nice.

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:14.100
Hey, wait.

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.980
Then I can't pay you alimony.

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:18.620
I have no source of income.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:19.840
Is that okay for you?

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:22.010
Three million won per month wasn't a small amount.

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:24.040
I paid it every month, never a day late.

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.520
Yes.

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:27.860
That's your way of apologizing.

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:30.060
Calling it even with money.

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:33.810
Exactly.

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:36.930
Can't you recognize my sincerity now?

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:38.560
Wait.

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:42.020
- I don't even expect your forgiveness. - Forgiveness?

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:44.060
Forgiveness?

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:56.800
Try paying 30 million, not three million won, until you die.

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.100
See if I'd forgive you.

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.800
He couldn't have...

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.680
been that hurt, could he?

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.040
Why do you care? He's not even yours anymore.

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.380
Who cares if he gets hurt?

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:20.610
Aigoo, I really can't understand CEO Seo.

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:22.740
His betrayal knows no bounds.

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:26.250
How could he bring him in without even a word to you?

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:33.740
Could he have something on CEO Seo?

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:35.900
Unni, I think...

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:39.070
he wants to try getting back with me.

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:40.140
What?

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:43.200
CEO Seo called me in earlier before I got off work.

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.610
And then he said...

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:49.320
Hey, Attorney Oh.

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:51.270
In my opinion,

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:52.970
I think he's done much reflecting.

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:54.640
Did you call me in to say that?

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:57.100
I feel sorry for him. He's going that far.

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:59.110
- CEO Seo! - Ha Ra...

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:02.630
can't you just give him one more chance?

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:09.980
Please take him back again.

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:11.530
Please?

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:15.120
Gosh, this is nuts.

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:18.080
This fogey, seriously...

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:21.810
He has seriously gone mad, hasn't he?

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:24.170
Hey...

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:27.050
you can't. Okay?

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:29.650
Once a cheater, always a cheater. You know this.

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:31.020
You think I'm crazy?

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:33.920
There are things I see and learn from this line of work.

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:36.570
That's right.

00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:39.890
You can't change someone. That's the truth.

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:41.490
Don't worry.

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:43.990
I'll never take him back in.

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:46.340
I'm not some pushover.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.730
You're already a pushover.

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:53.130
You've become a pushover.

00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:55.400
Aigoo, my alcohol's about to go bad.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.200
Let's stop talking about Goo Eun Beom now.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.470
Just don't take him back in, right?

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:01.230
Right.

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:02.980
You're right.

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:07.120
That's that, and to our left...

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:09.770
what do you think about them?

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:14.220
When did you even notice them?

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.400
Weren't you having a serious talk with me?

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:20.970
You think it's impossible to scan men while having a serious talk?

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:22.320
I can do everything.

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.850
Come on, look. Aren't they cute?

00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:26.120
What do you say?

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:28.100
We're feeling down anyway...

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:29.820
shall we join them?

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:33.580
I can't help but feel like I'm being used.

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:35.930
It's all in your head.

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:39.610
Kissing is the best for the forced collection of dopamine.

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:41.580
A deep kiss.

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:46.240
You're sober, right?

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.050
No, I don't want to. I can't.

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:49.340
You're an actor, aren't you?

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:50.640
Of course, I'd do it if it's acting.

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.610
But why do I have to go all the way there to act and shit?

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:54.810
Exactly.

00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:57.010
You can just do it with gusto like a drama.

00:23:57.010 --> 00:24:00.010
"I still love you. I'll never break up with you."

00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:01.650
Like that.

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:06.120
Why are you suddenly telling me to change my words?

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:11.300
At this point, we lack valid physical evidence to convince the judge right now.

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:14.400
If things go wrong, we might end up losing.

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:17.550
That's what other law firms also said, isn't it?

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:21.640
So, it's hard to make this a winning case because

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:24.260
Na Soo Yeon's responsibility hasn't been proven.

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:27.300
Fortunately, since we also don't have the responsibility,

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:31.940
even if they file a suit, it isn't easy for them to win, either.

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.700
If Na Soo Yeon's affair is certain,

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:38.400
the one who's more urgent for a divorce is them, not us.

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:43.920
But is there a reason to give your opponent what they want?

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.300
[Be Want Law Firm] Sorry?

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:55.260
My client doesn't want the divorce, I said.

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:58.540
What is she saying? That's not what you said.

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:00.480
You're the one who first brought up divorce.

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:03.300
I said it out of anger. I didn't mean it.

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:06.880
I still love you.

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:21.530
I understand.

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:23.760
Then we'll file a suit on our end.

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.140
Seeking agreement or adjustment will be difficult anyway.

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:29.330
Asking to proceed to trial right away would be better, right?

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:33.180
The responsible spouse is filing for a divorce?

00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:36.860
I guess you're trying to appeal to a marriage break-off by proving it,

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:38.070
but wouldn't that be in vain?

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:40.720
Recently, there was a precedence where the responsible spouse

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:44.420
has no right to divorce even after proving a break-off in marriage.

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:47.810
I guess you didn't get to check yet?

00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:49.800
Why are we the responsible spouse?

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:52.850
Rather, responsibility for the breakdown of marriage is on Han Do Woon,

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:55.220
note Na Soo Yeon.

00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:04.660
Whoa, things are getting interesting.

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:08.210
I got a call from a colleague a couple of days ago first time in forever.

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:10.330
Asking whether our firm is on this case or not.

00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:13.800
As expected, it's drawing attention because it's a celebrity lawsuit.

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:18.950
CEO Seo, you came to this meeting instead of going to your tango lesson today.

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:20.560
Seriously...

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.110
even my dance teacher grabs me, saying

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:25.380
Na Soo Yeon would never do that and

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:28.700
asking if Han Do Woon has morbid jealousy.

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:33.860
So, I said I'll look into it for sure.

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:37.160
Attorney Oh, doesn't that guy have morbid jealousy

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:40.520
and caused things to come this far because of delusions?

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:42.810
Are you really sure she cheated on him?

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:44.880
CEO Seo, what are you saying?

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:48.240
Is this our first time seeing this? The last straw strategy?

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:50.910
The media's going at it because it seems entertaining.

00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:52.070
Morbid jealousy, my foot.

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:54.570
If they had proof, they'd have quietly submitted it to the court

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:56.290
instead of letting the media know.

00:26:56.290 --> 00:26:58.910
And there's no decisive evidence for adultery yet?

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:02.640
I guess she prepared for a lawsuit for a long time.

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.150
There's nothing more.

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:06.600
Han Do Woon talked about hiring a private detective, but

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:10.410
I stopped him saying things would be harder for us if things backfired.

00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:13.150
For now, we requested fact-checks on Na Soo Yeon's

00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:15.400
financial transactions and travel history.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.570
I'm sure we'll get something-

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.570
What's this?

00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:23.190
- Did you call him in again, CEO Seo? - No.

00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:24.810
It wasn't me.

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:27.020
Why did you come? I said I was out of options now.

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:28.450
Hey...

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:30.170
Han Do Woon's morbid jealousy...

00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:33.390
- Is that true? - No, it-

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:35.850
No, it isn't.

00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:38.090
Did you come to ask that?

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.320
Then you were blindsided.

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:44.650
[Witness Request Form] The other party requested a psychiatrist as a witness.

00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:48.710
[Witness Request Form] Does this make sense to you?

00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:51.590
That you forgot about a psychiatric treatment because it's been too long?

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:53.220
I went about twice. That's all.

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:55.400
I went for insomnia because I couldn't sleep.

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.830
But you said you were struggling because of your ex-wife.

00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:59.970
That's because my emotions back then-

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:01.340
Do Woon.

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:05.070
People will say whatever they want to say to make their point.

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:06.980
You should've told me about this.

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:11.170
So you're telling an actor to say he saw a therapist to a lawyer he met for the first time.

00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:14.700
"Hello, I'm actor Han Do Woon. I've been seeing a therapist lately.

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:17.610
That doesn't matter, right?" Like that?

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:20.220
Will you take responsibility if it gets leaked? Huh?

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:21.400
Come on, Hyung.

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:23.580
Please calm down.

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:26.220
It was leaked, though?

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:29.110
I can't take responsibility even if I want to. They've got all the information.

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:31.750
Attorney Oh, please calm down, too.

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:34.310
Anyway, I don't have morbid jealousy.

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:36.830
So you take care of it.

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:39.510
That's what I hired you for.

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:40.960
Gosh...

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:42.960
Whoa, seriously.

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:46.100
Is a lawyer god or something?

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:48.840
That's what I'm saying.

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:50.780
Should I apply for a postponement of the trial?

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:52.870
What? And then what?

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:58.090
I'll be thinking about it after applying for the postponement.

00:28:58.090 --> 00:29:01.030
Is there a cause to apply for postponement?

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.760
I'll need to start thinking about it now.

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:06.290
Isn't the deadline tomorrow?

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:09.410
Gosh, this is crazy.

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:12.750
- Whoa, going home? - Yes.

00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:16.780
I'm going nuts here, seriously!

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:19.670
Attorney Goo, please leave today.

00:29:19.670 --> 00:29:21.440
You picked the wrong day.

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.110
What are you talking about?

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:26.670
Attorney Oh is having a mental breakdown because of the witness examination tomorrow.

00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:30.150
Looking at the list of questions, it seems the other party

00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:31.730
already got a plan with the psychiatrist.

00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:33.470
Okay.

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:36.300
Oh? No, no...

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:38.220
Hey, it won't end with just a bruise today.

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:40.290
- Okay. - Hey, it'll be hard to come out alive.

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:42.950
- Just for a moment. - Hey, not today. For real.

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:44.810
Hey! Come on.

00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:47.970
- Hey- - Okay, I understand. I got it.

00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:49.290
Geez...

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:51.810
Whatever.

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:56.390
Please just leave me alone today.

00:29:56.390 --> 00:29:58.400
I don't have the energy to argue with you.

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.880
How sad. What do you mean argue?

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:04.320
I didn't come to argue with you. I'm here to help you.

00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:07.290
I heard the witness examination's tomorrow, but you're stuck.

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:09.820
Because there's no loophole.

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:13.310
You'll create a loophole that isn't there for me?

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:15.040
Sure.

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:18.580
We have a great synergy when we think together, don't we?

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:22.030
Did you ever lose when you worked with me? Probably not.

00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:26.380
However, even if we're close, it's hard to do this for free.

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:29.110
I'll help you, so if you win the trial,

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:32.780
let me join the firm.

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.500
- Get out. - I mean...

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.770
I said get out of here!

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:45.230
- See? I told you it won't take a minute. - Aigoo.

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:50.160
She'd rather work with her parents' foe than get help from you.

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.090
- Aigoo. - Didn't I tell you?

00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:54.310
She's really a time bomb today.

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:57.100
But still, how can she throw her nameplate?

00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:59.950
Let's call it a day and go. I'll get my jacket from my office.

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:02.520
We can grab a drink tonight.

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:04.730
Let's do that next time.

How have you been-

00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:36.900
Oh, I'm sorry for calling at this late hour.

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:41.100
It's just that there's precedence I need to find.

- Is it going well? - You still haven't left?

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:42.940
Where would I go? I told you I'll help.

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:47.920

Han Do Woon, is it true you're suffering from morbid jealousy?

Han Do Woon, how do you plan to respond to the other party's defense?

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:14.060
Han Do Woon, please say a word about your current situation.

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:16.130
Han Do Woon, are there any hardships in defending yourself?

00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:20.250
Han Do Woon, is there a reason why you entrusted this case to Attorney Oh Ha Ra?

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:25.400
Are you certain the one you treated was Han Do Woon?

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.740
Of course. I've been his fan for a long time.

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:30.390
There's no way I wouldn't recognize him.

00:33:30.390 --> 00:33:33.270
Do you remember the date of his last treatment?

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:37.500
Well. I remember it being about two years ago. [Witness' Seat]

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:43.200
Then, could you explain to us the reason for the defendant's visit?

00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:46.800
Yes.

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:51.490
He sought to get zolpidem prescribed for his insomnia, which had worsened.

00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:54.310
- Did you prescribe him the medicine? - No, I didn't.

00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:57.070
I can't prescribe the medicine right away.

00:33:57.070 --> 00:34:00.550
I need to consult the patient first.

00:34:00.550 --> 00:34:03.840
In that case, what could be the cause of his insomnia?

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:08.000
Perhaps, was it because of Han Do Woon's circumstances back then?

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000
It was caused by his ex-wife's adultery and

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.280
and he had gotten worse at the time of his visit.

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:19.230
Is that so? Then why do you think his insomnia worsened?

00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:22.700
His relationship with the person who cheated on him was over.

00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:27.200
At the time, I heard he was seeing someone new.

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:30.850
If he couldn't reach her

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:34.180
or away from her too long, he felt anxious.

00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:37.910
I think his insomnia worsened because of that.

00:34:37.910 --> 00:34:42.030
Why would he get insomnia for not being able to reach someone?

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:43.700
It's simple.

00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:48.000
[Soo Yeon] You become anxious about the other person engaging in an affair.

00:34:55.650 --> 00:35:00.200
I see. Could you perhaps explain using a medical term?

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:05.640
I guess you can say it's a symptom of delusional jealousy or delusion of infidelity.

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:07.390
One moment.

00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:10.460
I think you can regard this one as a leading question.

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:14.430
Defendant, are you okay with that? Any problems with that?

00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:16.970
No, there is no problem.

00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:20.780
Since the defendant's representative says it's okay, we'll move on as is.

00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:23.010
Please go on.

00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:27.890
This is the end of questions for the witness. Thank you.

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:31.030
Defendant's Representative, counter-examination, please.

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:33.030
There's no counter-examination.

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:35.230
- What's this? - What is she doing?

00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:37.270
What's the meaning of this?

00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:39.300
Has she gone mad?

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:42.620
- Not a single counter-examination question? - No, there isn't.

00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:46.440
I think you can move on to the examination of parties.

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:55.530
Aren't you being too rash? She hasn't even won yet.

00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:58.640
You're really full of worries.

00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:01.500
[Promissory Note] If she loses, I'll give it back to you.

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:04.840
Hey, anyway, if you recover your principal this time,

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:07.730
uninstall all the stock apps, and don't even look at them.

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:11.660
- That's gambling, you know? - I told you this isn't for averaging down my stocks.

00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:14.640
This is for alimony payments to Ha Ra.

00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:19.390
Why would I do stocks when I don't even have the money for alimony?

00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:22.780
- I'm a crazy bastard. - That wasn't it?

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:25.810
You were right, but I'm not that crazy.

00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:27.900
My ex-wife is crazier than I am, so

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:31.490
I have a strong feeling I'll get to see the reincarnation of Shylock.

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:33.770
So, you should just get back together!

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:36.420
Or you can just marry her off to someone.

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:39.650
I heard you have to pay until Ha Ra dies or remarries.

00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:41.680
The alimony agreements.

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:47.880
Is it even possible... to be pimping for your ex-wife?

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:50.850
Of course, it's easier to get back together.

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:55.200
You still love Ha Ra, don't you?

00:36:56.370 --> 00:36:58.020
You must be learning how to read minds.

00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:00.160
Hey, it's obvious.

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:03.640
I've been a divorce lawyer for 30 years now!

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:07.370
In my opinion, you two are not over each other yet.

00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:12.830
Well, to put it in other words... hate is also love.

00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:14.990
Hotter than love, actually.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.400
Do you know what Ha Ra said if she'd lost this case?

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:28.510
She said she'd apply for a restraining order from the court.

00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:31.780
Last night, I wrote a note saying I won't come near her if she loses

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:33.600
and even put my fingerprint on it.

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:37.020
She said she'll submit it as evidence when she's applying for it later.

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:42.300
- What are you doing? - Hey...

00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:45.450
what if she intentionally loses to get rid of you?

00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:49.040
Geez! Write this after it's over.

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:50.690
When she wins.

00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:02.900
How did your marriage life with Han Do Woon affect your work, Plaintiff?

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:09.400
Ms. And Soo Yeon?

00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:13.440
Ms. And Soo Yeon!

00:38:15.610 --> 00:38:18.200
Communication is important between actors,

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:22.400
but it became hard to maintain a relationship with my partnering actors.

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:27.070
Obviously, the atmosphere on the set couldn't have been good.

00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:31.320
It wasn't easy to focus on acting as time passed by.

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:34.230
Did you talk to the defendant about how your work was affected

00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:36.520
and implored for his understanding?

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:38.640
Even if I tried...

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:42.410
nothing changed.

00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:46.050
Ultimately, I ended up concealing and giving excuses.

00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:50.290
And then, we'd fight and scream without fail.

00:38:51.110 --> 00:38:55.080
I understand. That'd be all.

00:38:56.890 --> 00:39:00.570
Defendant's Representative, will you pass on the counter-examination again?

00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:04.570
No, I'll proceed with a counter-examination.

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:11.950
Plaintiff.

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:18.080
How did you find out the defendant had psychiatric treatment history?

00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:20.090
I heard it from the defendant.

00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:22.520
When did you hear about that fact from him?

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:26.150
It was about three to four months after I met him.

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:28.290
He said his insomnia was severe,

00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:31.580
so I suggested he try going again.

00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:34.600
Since it's not a bad thing to see a therapist.

00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:38.530
By chance, did you also recommend a hospital to him?

00:39:38.530 --> 00:39:41.330
No, he looked into it himself.

00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:45.120
Saying he needs to be careful since he's an actor.

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:49.360
As he was getting psychiatric treatments,

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:53.290
did Han Do Woon's symptoms seem to improve?

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:57.010
No. He became busy with work,

00:39:57.010 --> 00:40:00.200
so he went to the hospital less often.

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:03.200
His symptoms were still the same.

00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:07.800
Then why did you decide to marry him?

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:11.530
If his mental health was concerning enough to recommend psychiatric treatment,

00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:13.240
why not just break up?

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:15.780
Why would you decide to marry him?

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:18.360
It's like jumping into a fire with hay on your back.

00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:27.790
Because...

00:40:28.930 --> 00:40:31.020
I loved him.

00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:35.830
I thought he would...

00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:38.710
get better if I tried hard.

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:50.460
You really did love him a lot, huh?

00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:51.570
What is it?

00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:54.170
That method you thought of.

00:40:55.610 --> 00:40:58.250
Admit to...

00:40:58.250 --> 00:41:00.490
morbid jealousy.

00:41:00.490 --> 00:41:01.830
Wh-What?

00:41:01.830 --> 00:41:03.570
I said, admit to morbid jealousy.

00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:07.910
Admit to morbid jealousy and make the morbid jealousy frame powerless.

00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:10.980
After that, you'll move

00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:13.270
the frame from morbid jealousy...

00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:15.340
to change of heart.

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:23.400
Now then, let's summarize.

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:27.600
Defendant Han Do Woon was a poor man suffering from morbid jealousy,

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:30.660
captivated by trauma from the past, before and after marriage.

00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:33.290
In short, nothing about him had changed.

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:37.760
But you are the one who changed.

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:43.200
So, the real cause of this divorce isn't Han Do Woon's morbid jealousy,

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:45.740
but your change of heart.

00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:47.770
That's the real reason, right?

00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:53.140
What is she saying?

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:55.080
Does that mean she's to blame?

00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:58.120
I object, Your Honor.

00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:00.880
Defendant's Representative is describing her opinion instead of questioning.

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:01.990
I admit.

What's the reason for the change of your sacrificial and beautiful love that wanted

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:16.100
to embrace everything about your loved one?

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:21.410
Perhaps, you found a new person after being emotionally drained because of

00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:24.540
endless doubts from your beloved husband.

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:26.400
Is that the reason?

Don't answer.

Although there's difficulty in

There's a duty to fully devote yourself to your spouse's recovery.

00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:32.560
Without such proper endeavors, you may not file for divorce

You may not.

Shall we go home now?

We're not able to communicate at all here.

Okay.

Let's end it now, Oppa.

00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:40.020
We'll pay 1.5 billion won first.

00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:43.620
We'll pay the rest in installments with the salary from the second half of the year.

Let's have you pay for the legal fees and

You didn't think I'd really get you that money, did you?

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.100
Realistically speaking, it's not easy to get five billion won in alimony.

00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:40.750
Are you satisfied with just getting the money without proving adultery?

00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:42.130
Do Woon.

00:45:42.130 --> 00:45:44.730

No, that's not what I mean.

00:57:11.590 --> 00:57:14.930
I live as a confident person wherever I go.

00:57:14.930 --> 00:57:16.140
Oh, CEO Hong, CEO Hong!

00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:17.550
You remember Attorney Oh's first trial, right?

00:57:17.550 --> 00:57:20.600
Come on, Attorney Oh didn't get nervous at all.

00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:23.630
She didn't tremble, but she just froze still like this.

00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:24.650
I also froze, didn't I?

00:57:24.650 --> 00:57:28.200
I also have colleagues I can spend working all day laughing.

00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:30.910
[Excellent Attorney Award Ceremony]

00:57:30.910 --> 00:57:32.120
Thank you.

00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:34.690
I love my work and

00:57:34.690 --> 00:57:36.800
I also got acknowledged.

00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:40.820
[Happy Star Han Do Woon] If this is the way to happiness...

00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:43.310
Yes.

00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:47.500
Are you free tonight?

00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:48.760
Why?

00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:50.250
I want to treat you to dinner.

00:57:50.250 --> 00:57:53.850
Commending a mutually achieved victory after a long time.

00:57:56.140 --> 00:57:58.630
I'll become happy no matter what.

00:57:59.690 --> 00:58:02.450
Regardless of you.

00:58:02.450 --> 00:58:03.870
What?

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.760
Sure. Let's have dinner.

00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:12.600
But one thing you must know clearly is that...

00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:14.700
the reason we're having dinner together is...

00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:21.270
because I decided to think of you as a coworker, not my ex-husband.

00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:22.410
Do you understand?

00:58:22.410 --> 00:58:24.710
Did I say something else?

00:58:25.890 --> 00:58:28.190
Seven o'clock at Moonlight.

00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:30.150
I'll make the reservation.

00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:36.400
Why do I have to eat with a coworker at such a romantic place

00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:39.290
even by bothering to make a reservation?

00:58:39.290 --> 00:58:42.400
Did he understand what I said or not?

00:58:50.850 --> 00:58:53.630
Hey, it's been such a long time.

00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:56.560
You like this place. Not really these days?

00:58:56.560 --> 00:58:59.130
No, that's not it.

00:58:59.130 --> 00:59:03.200
Why would we, as coworkers, have dinner at a blind date spot-

00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:05.040
He came early.

00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:11.070
You're here early.

00:59:11.070 --> 00:59:13.160
There was no traffic.

00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:32.080
Well, this is my hoobae, Jae Gyeom.

00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:34.160
You already had plans?

00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:36.120
You two should eat. Why invite me...

00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:39.940
- No, the thing- - It's fine. I'll leave first.

00:59:39.940 --> 00:59:41.730
Excuse me.

00:59:41.730 --> 00:59:45.200
I didn't plan to meet Hyung tonight.

00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:48.600
Aren't we on a blind date tonight?

00:59:52.930 --> 00:59:54.240
Ta-da.

00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:56.930
Surprise.

01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:33.920
What? Blind date? He's handsome!

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:35.450
Let's go, let's go!

01:00:35.450 --> 01:00:38.690
What's wrong with ex-wife and ex-husband talking to help each other's

01:00:38.690 --> 01:00:40.450
pursuit of happiness...

01:00:40.450 --> 01:00:42.200
Am I the only one who's uneasy?

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:45.320
The only attorney who takes a case by intercepting his ex-wife's client...

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:46.060
- Ta-da. - Are you a fraud?

01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:46.990
Are you a fraud?

01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:49.020
We're working together, undoubtedly. A joint appointment.

01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:50.100
This is adultery, 100 percent.

01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:51.810
Don't misunderstand what I have to say.

01:00:51.810 --> 01:00:53.990
Why would you have a conversation with a man?

01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:55.520
Unless it's talking with your body.

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:57.060
Talking with your body?

01:00:57.060 --> 01:00:58.740
Talk, you say?

01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:02.140
