[Crunch rubbing sound effect]

[Painful groans of the organization members]

00:19:27.666 --> 00:19:28.792
- (Gwangbok) Here it is. - (Hyeondong) Yes?

00:19:28.876 --> 00:19:30.043
- (Gwangbok) Here! - (Hyundong) Brother!

00:19:30.127 --> 00:19:31.003
(Liberation) Here, here!

00:19:31.086 --> 00:19:33.422
(Hyundong) My wrists are all folded [Liberation's urgent scream]

00:19:34.756 --> 00:19:36.008
[The members of the organization are making a fuss]

00:19:36.091 --> 00:19:37.968
[Children cheering]

00:19:41.138 --> 00:19:42.806
Should I call 119?

00:19:47.644 --> 00:19:49.021
[Screen highlight sound effect]

00:20:10.542 --> 00:20:12.419
[Child 2's cheers] (Organization member 1) No, look at this, look at this

00:20:12.502 --> 00:20:14.338
(Member 1) It's really unfair. We're the victims.

00:20:14.421 --> 00:20:15.255
Can't you see this?

00:20:15.339 --> 00:20:17.090
[The organization members keep protesting] (Organization member 2) Look at this.

00:20:17.174 --> 00:20:18.967
You can tell right away [kids are playing]

00:20:19.051 --> 00:20:20.469
[The members of the organization are making a fuss]

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:23.222
[Bong-soon's anxious moans]

00:20:24.765 --> 00:20:25.766
[Bong-soon's worried breathing]

00:20:25.849 --> 00:20:27.100
Oh, what should I do?

00:20:27.309 --> 00:20:30.187
Guk-du will think it's strange, what should I say?

00:20:31.104 --> 00:20:32.689
(Bong-soon) Oh my [a siren sounds in the distance]

00:20:33.315 --> 00:20:35.067
[There is a commotion inside the police station]

00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:41.990

[exhales urgently]

00:20:50.791 --> 00:20:51.833
(Bong-soon) Oh my, sir.

00:20:52.167 --> 00:20:54.086
[lively music] [Bongsoon mutters]

00:21:01.343 --> 00:21:02.219
[Bong-soon clears her throat]

[Sniffs the breath]

00:21:07.975 --> 00:21:09.851
Hey, Gukdu? [Minhyuk's empty laugh]

00:21:10.769 --> 00:21:12.229
Hey Gukdu, it's been a while

00:21:14.731 --> 00:21:16.650
Gukdu, you've had a hard time

00:21:18.235 --> 00:21:19.611
(Minhyuk) Oh, why is he doing that?

00:21:20.153 --> 00:21:21.655
[The police station is bustling]

00:21:25.075 --> 00:21:27.327
[The police station is bustling]

00:21:36.295 --> 00:21:37.337
(Gookdoo) Do Bong-soon!

00:21:37.671 --> 00:21:39.423
[Surprised groans from the organization members]

00:21:42.759 --> 00:21:44.428
(Member 2) [in a low voice] That guy, that guy, that guy, that guy

00:21:46.263 --> 00:21:47.889
[The members of the organization are muttering]

00:21:52.686 --> 00:21:54.646
[Sparkling sound effects] [Lovely music]

00:22:05.282 --> 00:22:08.201
(Member 3) No, detective! You say kids can't lie?

00:22:08.285 --> 00:22:09.786
[3rd member of the organization complains] Okay, name.

00:22:10.329 --> 00:22:11.538
[Tapping the keyboard] (Guk-du) Do Bong-soon

00:22:11.621 --> 00:22:15.834
Address: 1342 Dobong-dong, Dobong-gu

00:22:15.917 --> 00:22:17.377
(Gukdu) So those people

00:22:17.461 --> 00:22:20.464
They were occupying the middle of the road and blocking traffic.

00:22:20.547 --> 00:22:21.965
[Funny music] (Gukdu) Then, driver Jeong Seon-ho

00:22:22.049 --> 00:22:25.927
He asked me to move the car, but I refused and used force [camera shutter sound effect]

00:22:26.178 --> 00:22:28.930
I am using my cell phone for the purpose of reporting the situation.

00:22:29.014 --> 00:22:30.474
Do Bong Soon's cell phone... [Lovely music]

00:22:30.557 --> 00:22:32.642
(National Head) Kim Gwang-bok appears and takes it away

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:36.063
There was a dispute while asking for responsibility.

00:22:36.146 --> 00:22:37.898
[Funny Music] (Gukdu) Dobong-dong, Dobong-gu, Dobong-soon

00:22:37.981 --> 00:22:39.816
Price of Kim Gwang-bok's face

00:22:40.776 --> 00:22:42.778
[A gang member and a detective are arguing]

00:22:42.861 --> 00:22:44.946
The face is sunken...

00:22:45.113 --> 00:22:47.783
A popular picture of four teeth being lost...

00:22:47.866 --> 00:22:50.035
(Member 4) It's not a joke. Just throw it and it will fly. If you throw it, it will fly.

00:22:50.118 --> 00:22:51.453
(Guk-du) [letting out a strange sigh] On the other hand

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:54.331
[The organization members protest loudly] Hwang Hyeon-dong, who belatedly saw the damage to Kim Gwang-bok

00:22:54.414 --> 00:22:56.083
(National Head) In the process of controlling the situation [sharp sound effect]

00:22:56.166 --> 00:22:58.376
[Surprised groans from the organization members] (Guk-du) Five of Mr. Hwang's fingers

00:22:58.460 --> 00:22:59.836
Fractured on the spot

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:03.965
(National Head) He sent Jin-Tae Oh and Yong-Cheol Yang flying over 30 meters.

00:23:04.049 --> 00:23:06.051
Hit by a sand truck [sharp sound effect]

00:23:06.134 --> 00:23:09.596
[Surprised groans from the organization members] Each suffered injuries that resulted in fractures to the legs and neck.

00:23:09.679 --> 00:23:12.432
(Gukdu) Cha Youngnam, who came to take revenge on this

00:23:12.516 --> 00:23:14.434
I bumped into Mr. Kim and fell over

00:23:14.518 --> 00:23:19.898
Mr. Kim was blown over 10 meters and hit by a dump truck.

00:23:24.736 --> 00:23:25.821
Does this make sense?

00:23:27.739 --> 00:23:30.283
No, I mean, this is...

00:23:30.492 --> 00:23:31.451
[in a small voice] Look, look.

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:36.456
First of all, under the current law, kindergarten students' statements have no legal effect.

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.543
And it is a statement that makes no sense in terms of legal sentiment or common sense.

00:23:39.626 --> 00:23:40.627
(National Head) The problem is

00:23:42.212 --> 00:23:44.172
The point is that it was a statement made by the driver.

00:23:44.548 --> 00:23:47.217
(Gukdu) If this is true, then according to Article 750 of the Civil Act

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:50.303
This is an act of violence with intent and negligence, you will be punished.

00:23:50.387 --> 00:23:52.222
Unless there is a statement from a witness who reported at the time...

00:23:52.305 --> 00:23:54.891
(Minhyuk) Is that a martial arts novel or something you wrote as a report?

00:23:54.975 --> 00:23:55.934
(Member 1) What is that?

00:23:58.687 --> 00:24:00.981
(Minhyuk) Ah, our country's police are really a problem.

00:24:01.523 --> 00:24:03.275
You write statements like that and get paid?

00:24:03.358 --> 00:24:04.317
(Member 2) What is that?

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:06.987
I am the first reporter and witness [the organization members are in an uproar]

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:08.572
- (Member 1) What? - (Member 4) It wasn't there.

00:24:09.573 --> 00:24:10.574
[radio reception sound]

00:24:10.657 --> 00:24:13.618
(Minhyuk) Guys, you can't lie at the police station.

00:24:13.827 --> 00:24:16.788
Are you saying that this girl really beat up all these guys, all by herself?

00:24:16.872 --> 00:24:17.914
(Children) Yes!

00:24:17.998 --> 00:24:18.957
(Member 3) That's what I said

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.500
(Member 2) Kids lie. Kids can't lie.

00:24:20.584 --> 00:24:21.418
(Minhyuk) Bravo!

00:24:21.501 --> 00:24:23.503
Did you guys see 'Avengers' at kindergarten today?

00:24:23.962 --> 00:24:27.090
(Minhyuk) How on earth do they educate children in kindergarten?

00:24:27.174 --> 00:24:28.633
In the name of audiovisual education

00:24:28.717 --> 00:24:30.093
(Minhyuk) I'm just going to put on a movie on a fake day

00:24:30.177 --> 00:24:32.053
I need to search and seize that kindergarten too.

00:24:32.387 --> 00:24:33.805
Are you the first reporter?

00:24:34.973 --> 00:24:37.976
Yeah, well, I'm a reporter and a witness and stuff.

00:24:38.059 --> 00:24:39.686
(Minhyuk) Of course it's different from the driver's statement.

00:24:39.769 --> 00:24:42.355
Because he was a victim and a party involved in the incident.

00:24:42.439 --> 00:24:43.982
What, were you in your right mind? [The members of the organization stir]

00:24:44.316 --> 00:24:48.445
What was the situation at that time?

00:24:50.572 --> 00:24:54.993
Was it five minutes ago that the entire universe was in chaos?

00:24:55.535 --> 00:24:56.536
[Funny music]

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:59.414
False statements by witnesses are not punishable.

00:24:59.497 --> 00:25:01.958
If the victim files a civil suit, he or she must go to court.

00:25:02.042 --> 00:25:04.794
If you do that, you will eventually be punished for perjury.

00:25:04.878 --> 00:25:07.547
(Guk-du) Then how did those men get hurt like that?

00:25:08.173 --> 00:25:09.174
(Member 2) Speak straight.

00:25:09.257 --> 00:25:10.800
Look straight at me and talk. Look at me and talk.

00:25:10.884 --> 00:25:11.843
(Minhyuk) Oh, these people?

00:25:14.095 --> 00:25:16.389
They just fight among themselves

00:25:16.473 --> 00:25:17.724
[The organization members protest]

00:25:22.354 --> 00:25:23.396
(Team Leader Yuk) [Loudly] Quiet!

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:24.940
- (Nokboy) Sit down. - (Team Leader Yuk) Sit down!

00:25:25.023 --> 00:25:26.316
(Nockboy) Sit down, sit down.

00:25:27.859 --> 00:25:34.366
(Child 2) No, my older sister defeated all those men by herself.

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:37.244
[Funny music]

00:25:38.745 --> 00:25:39.913
(Minhyuk) Guys

00:25:42.666 --> 00:25:44.042
Can you read this?

00:25:49.256 --> 00:25:50.715
Look, look, okay?

00:25:50.799 --> 00:25:53.176
I don't have time to teach Korean, why?

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:55.303
Because I put on a movie on a fictional day

00:25:55.804 --> 00:25:59.099
(Minhyuk) It's like this since kindergarten, the foundation of all education. Oh my.

00:25:59.182 --> 00:26:02.143
(Team Leader Yuk) One girl is killing seven men.

00:26:02.227 --> 00:26:03.770
He said he was knocked down without a weapon

00:26:03.853 --> 00:26:05.647
This is nonsense from the start, this is

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:07.315
[The members of the organization protest loudly]

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:11.027
(Minhyuk) You say Hollywood ruins a lot of people?

00:26:11.403 --> 00:26:12.320
Hey there, guys!

00:26:12.404 --> 00:26:14.656
(Team Leader Yuk) What should I do for you guys today?

00:26:14.739 --> 00:26:17.075
Should I just throw everything away after blackmailing you into self-harm? What should I do?

00:26:17.158 --> 00:26:19.411
[The members of the organization protest loudly]

00:26:19.703 --> 00:26:21.371
(Team Leader Yuk) Who the hell hit this guy? Huh?

00:26:21.579 --> 00:26:23.623
Who broke this bridge like this?

00:26:23.707 --> 00:26:25.583
(Team Leader Yuk) Who the hell is this guy? Hey, hey

00:26:25.667 --> 00:26:27.752
Yeah, yeah, you cut it off, right?

00:26:31.006 --> 00:26:32.007
[Funny sound effect]

00:26:33.925 --> 00:26:35.552
(Team Leader Yuk) Hey, do it roughly, roughly

00:26:35.927 --> 00:26:39.431
Anyway, if I report this incident to the above, I'll get fired.

00:26:39.514 --> 00:26:42.475
(Team Leader Yuk) Hey, let's be honest and say that I got beaten up by a woman.

00:26:42.559 --> 00:26:44.185
Yeah? Seven men are getting robbed of their radish.

00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:46.271
(Team Leader Yuk) Does that mean that the bones are all there?

00:26:46.354 --> 00:26:47.314
[The members of the organization protest loudly]

00:26:47.397 --> 00:26:49.190
Since it didn't work out, I brought something that was kind of crappy

00:26:49.399 --> 00:26:50.817
Aren't you going to do that if you take charge of the case?

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:51.860
Driver assault

00:26:51.943 --> 00:26:54.404
He almost framed an innocent civilian for the crime.

00:26:54.487 --> 00:26:55.697
(Gukdu) We need to investigate and arrest him.

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:56.823
There is also a related criminal record

00:26:56.906 --> 00:26:58.325
[The members of the organization protest loudly]

00:26:59.534 --> 00:27:00.994

Is it good?

00:27:22.849 --> 00:27:26.102
(Gukdu) If you don't want to get caught by those bad people,

00:27:26.186 --> 00:27:29.856
Don't just play at home, go to work during the day, work, tsk

00:27:29.939 --> 00:27:32.108
[The organization members complain]

[Police car siren blares]

(Secretary Gong) What on earth is going on that requires you to go to the police station...

00:27:52.379 --> 00:27:55.757
(Minhyuk) Wow, I've seen all sorts of strange things in my life.

00:27:56.216 --> 00:27:57.175
(Secretary Gong) Yes?

00:27:57.425 --> 00:27:58.426
Hey, hey

[Minhyuk coughs in vain]

That woman

00:39:52.014 --> 00:39:54.558
Hey, I know that girl. The girl I saw at the police station.

00:39:56.644 --> 00:39:57.895
(Minhyuk) Yeah, that woman

00:39:58.104 --> 00:40:00.689
The girl you're thinking about right now, huh?

00:40:01.107 --> 00:40:02.108

No, that cop in charge was really tough.

00:40:24.088 --> 00:40:25.756

You little shit, do you have a warrant?

00:41:25.566 --> 00:41:28.736
(National Head) I plan to apply for a warrant within 24 hours of arrest.

00:41:29.153 --> 00:41:30.946
[Man 2's scream] (Guk-du) There is a concern about running away

I will arrest you first.

'Cases, gifts or entertainment should not be investigated'

It says so explicitly

00:41:53.511 --> 00:41:55.763
(Gukdu) No, I did it because they told me to conduct an investigation without sanctuary.

00:41:55.846 --> 00:41:58.682
I caught him and he's a member of the National Assembly. Is that my fault?

00:42:00.226 --> 00:42:02.186
(Police Officer 1) Hey, Inspector In, do something about it.

00:42:02.269 --> 00:42:06.148
If you keep doing this, you'll just disappear in one room without anyone knowing.

[hitting the desk] Come on, give it a try!

00:42:10.361 --> 00:42:11.779

Hey, this guy's a little bit spicy

He was a famous loser when he was in police academy

I, that, that, that's what it was

00:42:27.545 --> 00:42:31.090
Ha, that kid will suffocate to death on that smoke.

00:42:31.298 --> 00:42:32.258
Send it to the traffic department! Mr.

00:42:32.341 --> 00:42:35.261
No, that's, I, I have a lot of eyes to see, so that's a bit...

00:42:35.344 --> 00:42:37.972
Then you guys are the ones with the worst performance

00:42:38.055 --> 00:42:39.431

Let's start from the basics and work our way up, okay?

00:42:59.326 --> 00:43:01.203
[Rhythmic music]

00:43:12.006 --> 00:43:16.010
Hello, my name is In-Guk Doo and I have been assigned to the 3rd Violent Team starting today.

00:43:22.224 --> 00:43:24.727
(Chief of Police) That kid is a complete idiot who doesn't make any sense.

00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:26.061
Oh, my head hurts.

00:43:26.812 --> 00:43:28.606
He's a really good cop.

00:43:28.689 --> 00:43:29.565
what?

00:43:31.317 --> 00:43:33.319
But what are you going to do with that woman's number?

00:43:33.402 --> 00:43:34.361
Because you're my type

00:43:34.445 --> 00:43:36.280
Oh, was that something you needed for the youth project?

00:43:36.864 --> 00:43:37.990
Well, let me say this

00:43:38.574 --> 00:43:39.950
Chairman Ahn, how are you?

00:43:40.034 --> 00:43:41.785
Oh, yes, thanks

00:43:42.911 --> 00:43:46.123
Thank you for helping my father in many ways throughout his life.

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:47.708
Ka, me too

00:43:47.958 --> 00:43:52.379
[Putting the cup down] I'm so proud of you for being so successful without your father's help.

00:43:52.921 --> 00:43:57.551
But, there is a limit to what you can do without a hundred.

[Eat the crunchy fruit] [TV sound flows out]

00:44:08.062 --> 00:44:10.189
Should I just live my life doing hard work?

00:44:10.272 --> 00:44:12.191
(Bong-soon) The hourly wage for day labor is different.

00:44:12.274 --> 00:44:13.859
Well, that's not a bad thing, is it?

00:44:15.194 --> 00:44:18.697
(Jin) Bongsoon, stop eating. Let Bonggi eat.

00:44:18.781 --> 00:44:21.742
And I'm using my power wrong

00:44:21.825 --> 00:44:24.703
You've just had the worst day ever, what are you talking about?

00:44:24.787 --> 00:44:26.622
[Chilgu giggles]

00:44:27.373 --> 00:44:28.957
I married this guy

00:44:29.333 --> 00:44:30.417
(Chilgu) Oh, why?

00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:33.587
(Bong-soon) Oh my... [cell phone vibrates]

00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:43.972
Yes, I am Do Bong-soon. Who are you?

[Secretary Gong exhales]

00:44:58.445 --> 00:45:01.448
(Secretary Gong) So, you are not doing anything special right now?

00:45:01.532 --> 00:45:02.616
[Bong-soon coughs]

00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:07.663
[In a sharp tone] I'm looking for a job, in technical terms. I'm not unemployed.

00:45:07.996 --> 00:45:09.998
(Secretary Gong) [smiling awkwardly] Oh, yes.

00:45:10.541 --> 00:45:11.500
No, well, anyway

00:45:12.126 --> 00:45:14.336
That day, our CEO saw Do Bong-soon.

00:45:15.003 --> 00:45:17.923
It was so impressive that I was able to make such a bold decision.

00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:19.800
[Bongsoon clicks her tongue] [Puts her drink down]

00:45:19.967 --> 00:45:22.594
Oh, that guy is really annoying to the end.

00:45:23.554 --> 00:45:25.305
- (Secretary Gong) Yes? - No, if you have something to say

00:45:25.389 --> 00:45:28.100
Why don't you come and do it yourself? Why are you having someone do it for you?

00:45:28.267 --> 00:45:30.185
Even the man looks much older than me.

00:45:30.269 --> 00:45:31.895
[Secretary Gong's awkward smile]

00:45:34.064 --> 00:45:36.984
(Secretary Gong) Oh, you can just think of it as the first interview.

00:45:37.067 --> 00:45:38.026
(Bong-soon) [smiling awkwardly] Yes

00:45:38.527 --> 00:45:40.362
Huh, first interview?

00:45:40.446 --> 00:45:41.321
(Secretary Gong) Yes

00:45:43.657 --> 00:45:46.326
So, are you calling me that representative now?

00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:49.496
Well, anyway, well, you're telling me to do personal security for that guy?

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:53.709
Oh, yes, we will offer you the best salary in the industry.

00:45:53.792 --> 00:45:55.836
Sir, it's me

00:45:55.919 --> 00:45:58.797
There's nothing I haven't done since I graduated from high school, right?

00:45:58.922 --> 00:46:00.716
A scam company, a fucking company or

00:46:00.841 --> 00:46:02.968
The company that really works hard is very fast

00:46:03.051 --> 00:46:05.929
(Bong-soon) And, I think 'rather than using this body'

00:46:06.013 --> 00:46:07.723
'I will live using my head'

00:46:07.806 --> 00:46:09.433
(Bong-soon) Well, there is this kind of job outlook too.

00:46:09.933 --> 00:46:13.145
I don't know why you are making this suggestion to me, but

00:46:13.228 --> 00:46:14.313
(Bong-soon) And I

00:46:14.396 --> 00:46:18.358
Do you have a specific industry and company in mind that you would like to work for?

00:46:18.442 --> 00:46:21.695
Oh, I'm sorry, but may I ask what kind of industry you are in?

00:46:21.778 --> 00:46:23.238
That's my private life, right?

00:46:24.239 --> 00:46:26.492
I'm really sorry for refusing you after coming all the way here.

00:46:26.575 --> 00:46:27.868
Then take a look

00:46:28.327 --> 00:46:29.828
(Secretary Gong) Yes, annual salary 60 million [tire friction sound effect]

[Funny music] (Bong-soon) Sir, by any chance

00:46:46.053 --> 00:46:48.722
What, an entertainment establishment pretending to be a security guard?

00:46:48.805 --> 00:46:50.182
Isn't that it? [Secretary Gong laughs]

00:46:50.265 --> 00:46:52.309
(Bong-soon) Why on earth do you pay me so much?

00:46:52.392 --> 00:46:53.894
What the hell do you know about me?

00:46:53.977 --> 00:46:55.854
- Does that person like me? - (Secretary Gong) No, no.

00:46:55.938 --> 00:46:57.564
Oh, come to think of it, how did you know my phone number?

00:46:57.648 --> 00:46:58.857
[Taking a surprised breath] Am I stalking you?

00:46:58.941 --> 00:47:00.234
(Secretary Gong) No, no, that's not it.

00:47:00.317 --> 00:47:01.485
(Bong-soon) No, and, come to think of it,

00:47:01.568 --> 00:47:02.861
Why don't you use male bodyguards?

00:47:02.945 --> 00:47:05.239
Why do you have to use female bodyguards? That's the weirdest thing to me.

00:47:05.322 --> 00:47:06.615
(Bong-soon) Oh my, when I think about it, it's really strange.

00:47:06.698 --> 00:47:08.283
(Secretary Gong) No, no, listen for a minute, listen for a minute.

00:47:08.367 --> 00:47:10.494
(Bong-soon) Ears? Oh my, why ears? Oh my, oh my, oh my

(Secretary Gong) The man... [Car noise]

00:47:13.413 --> 00:47:15.582
Boy, does that really make sense?

00:47:15.666 --> 00:47:18.210
(Bong-soon) No, what's the name of that company? What exactly is its name?

00:47:18.293 --> 00:47:19.711

00:48:02.087 --> 00:48:03.714
Call the district office and city hall

00:48:03.797 --> 00:48:06.466
I do about ten cases a day.

00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:08.010
(Myeongsu's mother) You're against redevelopment here, right?

00:48:08.093 --> 00:48:09.052
(Jin) Hmm

00:48:09.469 --> 00:48:13.181
Let's just get someone to cut their hair, okay? [Myeongsu mocks snorting]

00:48:13.265 --> 00:48:14.224
Jaesoon's mom cut it

00:48:14.308 --> 00:48:18.937
Hehe, really, shaving your head and fasting and stuff like that won't work

00:48:19.479 --> 00:48:22.024
(Myeongsu's mother) I just called the civil servant in charge and the person in charge of redevelopment.

00:48:22.107 --> 00:48:24.192
[Sound effect of a ball clinking] I guess it has to be Daidai, yeah

00:48:24.276 --> 00:48:27.237
But actually, I am in favor of redevelopment.

00:48:27.321 --> 00:48:28.739
(Jaesun's mother) That laundry alley

00:48:28.947 --> 00:48:31.491
I can't go out after 10pm because I'm scared.

00:48:31.575 --> 00:48:34.870
Yeah, we really need to figure out something quickly there.

00:48:35.203 --> 00:48:36.872
These days, these neighborhood thugs are hired

00:48:36.997 --> 00:48:39.041
I can't even tell you why I'm wandering around like this

00:48:39.124 --> 00:48:40.208
Oh my, it's Gukdu's mom

00:48:40.709 --> 00:48:41.752
[The doorbell rang]

00:48:42.753 --> 00:48:44.671
[Sparkling sound effects] [Classy music]

00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:47.257
(Chilgu) Oh, hello

00:48:47.341 --> 00:48:49.134
- (Jin-i) I'm just unlucky. - (Myeong-su's mother) Look at that little girl.

00:48:49.217 --> 00:48:50.302
[The artist greets] Yes, welcome.

00:48:50.385 --> 00:48:51.595
(Myeongsu's mother) I'll let you go every day

00:48:51.678 --> 00:48:54.973
Egg tarts, four, and pecan pie, two pieces, please.

00:48:55.641 --> 00:48:57.225
[Jin-i imitates Mi-hwa] [Jae-sun imitates laughter]

00:48:57.309 --> 00:49:00.437
(Chilgu) Oh, I... I read the novel well.

00:49:01.146 --> 00:49:03.273
'Hormones in the corner of the room' [Chilgu's Laughter]

00:49:03.899 --> 00:49:06.276
(Beauty) Oh, did you have fun?

00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:08.737
Yes, I read it all in one day

00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:10.113
(Chilgu) I've never done that in my entire life.

00:49:10.197 --> 00:49:13.075
This is the first book I've read while quickly turning the pages.

00:49:13.158 --> 00:49:14.993
(Chilgu) Just flowing smoothly...

00:49:15.077 --> 00:49:16.828
[Mihwa and Chilgu's laughter]

00:49:18.330 --> 00:49:19.373
(beautiful) Oh, right

00:49:19.873 --> 00:49:21.917
A few days ago, our national bean

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.378
You met Bongsoon at the police station?

00:49:24.461 --> 00:49:25.379
[tensing sound effect] Huh?

00:49:25.629 --> 00:49:26.797
(Myeongsu's mother and Jaesun's mother) Police station?

00:49:30.592 --> 00:49:32.469
[bright music]

00:49:37.057 --> 00:49:38.058
yes

00:49:43.271 --> 00:49:44.314
(Bong-soon) Okay...

00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:47.984
(Jin) Bongsoon!

00:49:48.694 --> 00:49:50.112
- (Jin) Bongsoon! - (Bongsoon) Let's eat.

00:49:50.195 --> 00:49:51.363
(Jin) Come here

00:49:52.698 --> 00:49:54.449
- (Bong-soon) Oh, why? - (Jin-i) You, you!

00:49:54.533 --> 00:49:56.493
Why did you go to the police station, why did you go?

00:49:56.576 --> 00:49:57.744
Mom, how did you know that?

00:49:57.828 --> 00:49:59.830
How come I don't know that Guk-du works at the police station?

00:50:00.330 --> 00:50:03.750
Where the hell are you going girl? Why are you going there, why are you going there!

00:50:03.834 --> 00:50:05.877
(Bong-soon) No, well, it just happened that way.

00:50:05.961 --> 00:50:09.005
(Jin) Hey, did you hit someone? Did you hit someone, did you hit someone?

00:50:09.089 --> 00:50:11.216
No, Mom, what happened is...

00:50:11.299 --> 00:50:12.300
Is he crazy?

00:50:12.718 --> 00:50:14.136
Haven't you heard what your grandmother said?

00:50:14.219 --> 00:50:15.887
(Jin-i) My grandmother, I beat up a guy at the market

00:50:15.971 --> 00:50:18.598
I had diarrhea for a whole month and then I got hemorrhoids.

00:50:18.682 --> 00:50:19.808
And me, look at me!

00:50:19.891 --> 00:50:21.852
Mom, I'm fine

00:50:22.519 --> 00:50:24.938
Actually, I've had that happen a lot up until now, right?

00:50:25.355 --> 00:50:26.982
But am I okay?

00:50:27.065 --> 00:50:27.941
what?

00:50:28.024 --> 00:50:31.653
(Bong-soon) Mom, I think I'm a mutant.

00:50:31.737 --> 00:50:32.821
[laugh]

00:50:33.071 --> 00:50:36.283
And then I got a job

00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:39.745
[Cheerful music] Now I'm going to use my talent

00:50:39.828 --> 00:50:40.662
[Bongsoon's cheers]

00:50:40.912 --> 00:50:42.748
(Uprising) Mom, Sister, I'm hungry

00:50:42.831 --> 00:50:44.624
[in an affectionate tone] Hey, Bong-gi, are you hungry?

00:50:44.708 --> 00:50:46.001
(Bong-gi) Why is this happening? [Bong-soon's cheerful exclamation]

00:50:46.084 --> 00:50:48.211
[Bong-soon's scream] (Bong-soon) Oh, oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

00:50:48.295 --> 00:50:49.588
Oh, are you okay? [Bonggi's groan]

00:50:49.671 --> 00:50:51.882
(Bong-soon) I'm excited, sorry, okay? Let's go.

00:50:51.965 --> 00:50:53.467
[Bong-gi's groans] (Bong-soon) Oh, let's go.

00:50:53.550 --> 00:50:54.384
[Painful groans of uprising]

00:50:55.886 --> 00:50:56.803
(Bongsoon) Yeah

00:50:57.345 --> 00:50:58.597
Mom, liver

00:50:59.264 --> 00:51:00.557
(Jin) First... [Jin coughs]

00:51:05.312 --> 00:51:06.229
- (Jin-i) Hmm - (Chil-gu) Yeah

00:51:06.313 --> 00:51:07.272
Let's eat well (together)

00:51:07.355 --> 00:51:08.273
(Chilgu) Looks delicious

00:51:13.904 --> 00:51:15.739
[cell phone vibrating]

00:51:17.866 --> 00:51:19.034
(Jin) It tastes good...

00:51:19.951 --> 00:51:21.870
- (Bong-gi) Hmm - (Jin-i) Hmm?

00:51:23.622 --> 00:51:24.539
hello

00:51:24.998 --> 00:51:25.916
(Gukdu) Oh, it's me

00:51:26.291 --> 00:51:28.335
[Lovely music]

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:31.713
(Bong-soon) Yeah, I know

00:51:31.797 --> 00:51:35.133
(Gukdu) I looked into the men who assaulted me at the redevelopment site today.

00:51:35.217 --> 00:51:38.512
Those guys are really bad, so don't go out late at night.

00:51:38.595 --> 00:51:40.514
And carry an electric shock device with you

00:51:41.056 --> 00:51:43.600
I have a few basic ones, so I'll give them to you when I leave work.

00:51:44.059 --> 00:51:45.352
(Bong-soon) Okay

00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:46.645
- Hang up - Kookdooya

00:51:46.728 --> 00:51:48.605
I think I'll get a job

00:51:48.688 --> 00:51:49.773
(National Head) Cut [Sound effect of Kim Sae]

00:51:51.525 --> 00:51:54.402
Um, sir... bad guy

00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:55.737
Tsk

00:51:55.946 --> 00:51:57.697
Open it, there's no way

00:51:58.865 --> 00:52:01.243
[joyful gasp]

00:52:01.326 --> 00:52:04.246
But I still like it so much [Bong-soon laughs]

00:52:04.538 --> 00:52:06.164
[groans mixed with laughter]

00:52:06.248 --> 00:52:07.374
[Bongsoon's scream]

00:52:07.457 --> 00:52:08.542
[The startled groans of uprising]

00:52:09.501 --> 00:52:11.253
(Jin) Oh, here we go again

00:52:11.503 --> 00:52:12.921
(Chilgu) Shouldn't we add some seaweed powder? Seaweed powder

00:52:13.004 --> 00:52:14.172
(Jin) Yeah, that's right

00:52:15.674 --> 00:52:16.758
[A knock is heard]

00:52:17.008 --> 00:52:17.968
yes

00:52:19.052 --> 00:52:20.804
(Bong-soon) [smiling awkwardly] Hello

00:52:21.888 --> 00:52:23.056
Oh, come in. [Puts the papers down]

00:52:27.769 --> 00:52:29.271
(Minhyuk) Sit down, the ceiling won't collapse.

00:52:29.354 --> 00:52:30.313
(Bong-soon) Yes

00:52:31.982 --> 00:52:32.983
Did you bring your resume?

00:52:33.066 --> 00:52:33.942
yes

00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:41.867
Have you ever interviewed at our company?

00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:42.868
(Bong-soon) Yes

00:52:44.202 --> 00:52:47.205
(Minhyuk) What? You want to come to our company with this kind of experience?

00:52:47.622 --> 00:52:48.540
You're brave

00:52:48.623 --> 00:52:51.918
I applied because they said the company didn't look at academic background, age, or gender.

00:52:52.085 --> 00:52:54.546
Brave, definitely brave

00:52:54.629 --> 00:52:56.673
(Minhyuk) Dobong-dong, Dobong-gu, Dobong-sun

00:52:56.756 --> 00:52:59.050
[Laughing] What, you moved to Dobong-dong to match your name?

00:52:59.134 --> 00:53:01.553
So then, do arsonists only live in Banghwa-dong?

00:53:01.636 --> 00:53:03.138
Does Yeonhee live in Yeonhee-dong?

00:53:06.391 --> 00:53:08.351
Sorry, I thought it would be funny

00:53:08.435 --> 00:53:09.644
- (Minhyuk) Old - (Bongsoon) Yes

00:53:09.728 --> 00:53:12.105
[Slamming the file shut] Why did you want to join our company?

00:53:12.188 --> 00:53:13.607
Because it's a good company

00:53:16.109 --> 00:53:17.694
- Let's do our best - Yes

00:53:18.528 --> 00:53:20.530
But it's a shame it's not the planning and development team, right?

00:53:20.614 --> 00:53:22.198
- Yes - Um...

00:53:22.699 --> 00:53:24.659
I have a question.

00:53:26.119 --> 00:53:31.207
You look healthy and your limbs are intact, so why do you need bodyguards?

00:53:31.291 --> 00:53:32.959
I have enemies all around me

00:53:33.793 --> 00:53:35.837
Oh, don't get me wrong, I'm not a bad person.

00:53:36.379 --> 00:53:37.839
Yes, of course

00:53:38.381 --> 00:53:41.968
Oh, and incentive system or national pension

00:53:42.052 --> 00:53:43.386
How does that work?

00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:44.512
[laughs]

00:53:45.138 --> 00:53:46.598
Differential treatment based on ability

00:53:46.932 --> 00:53:48.725
I need to know how capable you are.

00:53:48.934 --> 00:53:51.102
- Does your company have a cafeteria? - Yes.

00:53:51.186 --> 00:53:52.270
What about menstrual leave?

00:53:52.354 --> 00:53:53.480
[let out a sigh of relief]

00:53:54.940 --> 00:53:55.774
There isn't any

00:53:55.857 --> 00:53:58.109
Well, it's poor.

00:53:58.193 --> 00:54:00.820
(Minhyuk) Bodyguards are on duty 24/7 due to the nature of their work.

00:54:01.655 --> 00:54:03.281
Yeah, well, what

00:54:03.657 --> 00:54:05.408
Is there 'stop motion'? [screen highlight sound effect]

00:54:05.492 --> 00:54:07.452
[Crazy music] [Crazy sound effects]

00:54:13.917 --> 00:54:16.628
What is 'stop motion'?

00:54:16.711 --> 00:54:17.879
'Stop motion'

00:54:18.672 --> 00:54:19.631
I don't know?

00:54:20.590 --> 00:54:21.675
[Takes a shallow breath]

00:54:23.301 --> 00:54:24.302
[in a whisper] Stock options, perhaps?

00:54:24.386 --> 00:54:25.929
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's it.

00:54:26.012 --> 00:54:28.139
[ridiculous laughter] [humorous music]

00:54:29.057 --> 00:54:30.225
(Minhyuk) Ah...

00:54:31.226 --> 00:54:35.897
Let's think about how to give stock options to security guards.

00:54:36.815 --> 00:54:38.525
As expected, it's poor

00:54:40.694 --> 00:54:43.989
(Bong-soon) Then, can I see the contract first?

00:54:48.535 --> 00:54:49.744
(Minhyuk) Let's try arm wrestling together

00:54:49.828 --> 00:54:50.704
yes?

00:54:50.787 --> 00:54:53.164
It's an entrance exam that requires you to look at your ability to negotiate a salary.

00:54:53.623 --> 00:54:54.708
Come on, hurry up

00:54:56.501 --> 00:54:57.460
hurry

00:54:58.003 --> 00:55:00.171
(Bong-soon) Hey, arm wrestling...

00:55:04.968 --> 00:55:05.969
Hand it over

00:55:07.012 --> 00:55:08.346
Pass it over

00:55:10.265 --> 00:55:11.349
[Minhyuk's empty laughter]

00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:14.686
[Minhyuk's powerful breathing] [Exciting music]

00:55:18.481 --> 00:55:19.941
You can use this too

00:55:20.025 --> 00:55:21.693
Oh, I really...

00:55:22.277 --> 00:55:23.611
Who... [Minhyuk's powerful groan]

00:55:29.159 --> 00:55:30.160
[Bongsoon's sigh]

00:55:30.744 --> 00:55:32.037
[Minhyuk's scream]

00:55:35.165 --> 00:55:37.083
[Min-hyeok's painful groan] (Bong-soon) Ah, I lost to a woman.

00:55:37.167 --> 00:55:39.252
Don't be shy or angry

00:55:39.335 --> 00:55:41.296
Because I'm a bit of a special case

00:55:42.005 --> 00:55:44.257
And I'd like you to keep this a secret, please?

00:55:44.591 --> 00:55:45.592
[Minhyuk lets out a breathless sigh]

00:55:46.092 --> 00:55:47.302
[Minhyuk's awkward laugh]

There hasn't been an accident in this neighborhood

01:05:38.559 --> 01:05:39.477
(Myeongsu Mo) That's right

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:41.228
(Jaesun's mother) No, what should I do? Where are you going?

01:05:41.395 --> 01:05:42.521
(Myeongsu's mother) Just stay still

01:05:44.231 --> 01:05:45.399
(Resident) Oh my god, what should I do?

01:05:45.483 --> 01:05:46.651
(Jaesun's mother) Myeongsu's mother, come here.

01:05:46.734 --> 01:05:47.652
(Jaesun's mother) Myeongsu's mother!

01:05:47.735 --> 01:05:49.987
(Jin) [gasps in surprise] He's dead, he's dead?

01:05:54.742 --> 01:05:56.619
[Eerie music plays]

01:05:57.828 --> 01:05:59.080
[Bong-soon's surprised gasp]

01:06:01.874 --> 01:06:03.042
(Minhyuk) Didn't I tell you that there are enemies everywhere?

01:06:03.125 --> 01:06:04.460
(Bong-soon) Oh, that's surprising.

01:06:05.878 --> 01:06:06.796
What is this?

01:06:06.879 --> 01:06:09.048
Well, what could it be?

01:06:09.298 --> 01:06:10.925
That's one of the reasons I hired you.

01:06:11.592 --> 01:06:14.220
(Minhyuk) For those in the IT industry, threats are also digital.

01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:15.805
- (Minhyuk) Is it fun? - (Bongsoon) Wow

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:19.517
[Elegant music flows out]

01:06:21.310 --> 01:06:24.397
I have been being followed and threatened for some time now.

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:25.314
To whom?

01:06:25.398 --> 01:06:26.857
I don't know, if I knew I would have caught it

01:06:26.941 --> 01:06:27.942
Then report it to the police.

01:06:28.025 --> 01:06:30.027
I hate the police, I don't trust them

01:06:30.403 --> 01:06:31.654
I'll catch it

01:06:33.489 --> 01:06:34.782
- Help me. - Yes?

01:06:34.907 --> 01:06:36.158
You liked games, right?

01:06:36.242 --> 01:06:37.660
(Minhyuk) Why, it's thrilling

01:06:37.743 --> 01:06:39.245
Let's catch it, like a game

01:06:39.578 --> 01:06:40.663
It's fun

01:06:43.290 --> 01:06:44.250
[Minhyuk coughs in vain]

01:06:44.333 --> 01:06:46.502
You wanted to do game planning and development? Try it.

01:06:47.211 --> 01:06:48.546
We are the winners no matter what

01:06:49.714 --> 01:06:50.840
Are you kidding me?

01:06:50.923 --> 01:06:53.426
Hey, life is a game, the game is life.

01:06:53.509 --> 01:06:55.386
There's nothing serious [picks up fork]

01:06:58.139 --> 01:06:59.849
(Minhyuk) What do you think? Don't kill me.

01:06:59.932 --> 01:07:03.644
If you catch that kid, you'll be hired as a full-time employee in our company's planning and development team.

01:07:03.728 --> 01:07:06.897
And how about I develop your plan, Cole?

01:07:06.981 --> 01:07:08.482
(Anchor on TV) Last night around midnight at the Cheongun intersection in Dobong-dong

(Anchor on TV) A murder has occurred.

01:07:10.901 --> 01:07:13.738
The murdered woman was a single woman in her thirties [Meaningful Music]

01:07:13.821 --> 01:07:16.866
I feel even more sad because my wedding is coming up in two months.

01:07:17.324 --> 01:07:18.659
(Anchor on TV) There are currently no witnesses.

01:07:18.743 --> 01:07:22.496
There is no evidence that could be a clue, such as CCTV or black box, around here.

01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:25.207
Police say they are having difficulty with the initial investigation

01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:29.378
The victim, Ms. Jeong, was a woman who worked in the inspection team of a nearby large bookstore. [Cell phone vibrating sound]

01:07:29.462 --> 01:07:31.505
(Anchor on TV) After finishing overtime work that day, I went home as usual...

01:07:31.839 --> 01:07:33.382
[Remote control operation sound] [Mobile phone vibration sound]

01:07:40.848 --> 01:07:42.475
(Threatener) [in distorted voice] Don't ignore my warning.

01:07:42.558 --> 01:07:44.560
Looking forward to what happens next

01:07:45.561 --> 01:07:47.563

[Ending song]

01:08:20.763 --> 01:08:23.099
(Minhyuk) Someone must be watching you and me from somewhere.

01:08:23.182 --> 01:08:24.517
(Minhyuk) Oh, you never know, there might be explosives?

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:25.476
(Bong-soon) Are you telling me to die?

01:08:25.559 --> 01:08:26.393
(Minhyuk) Then I die?

01:08:26.477 --> 01:08:28.896
(Jin) Where is the crazy rich guy?

01:08:28.979 --> 01:08:30.397
[Whinning] Let's sleep together at my house

01:08:30.481 --> 01:08:31.315
How is it?

01:08:31.398 --> 01:08:32.733
(Jin) I love it, I love it

01:08:32.817 --> 01:08:35.861
(Minhyuk) Do you like that cop? He's totally my type.

01:08:35.945 --> 01:08:36.862
(Bongsoon) I'm gay

01:08:36.946 --> 01:08:39.657
It's okay, there's no such flawless man these days.

01:08:40.074 --> 01:08:41.117
(Myeongsu's mother) The woman got hurt again.

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:42.118
[Woman 4's scream]

01:08:42.201 --> 01:08:43.160
(Woman 4) Excuse me, please save me.

01:08:43.244 --> 01:08:44.620
(Bear) Where the hell are you crawling in here?

01:08:44.703 --> 01:08:46.997
(National Head) The culprit has appeared. The ward must be closed.

01:08:47.081 --> 01:08:48.791
(Bong-soon) I heard the criminal's voice.

01:08:48.874 --> 01:08:50.000
(Gukdu) I've been out of the scene

01:08:50.084 --> 01:08:51.335
That bastard came in a few minutes

01:08:51.502 --> 01:08:52.545
(Minhyuk) Call 119, quickly!

01:08:52.628 --> 01:08:54.130
(Guk-doo) That kid saw Bong-soon's face.

01:08:54.213 --> 01:08:57.174
(Bong-soon) Even if you have strength, it's of no use in a situation like this.

01:08:57.508 --> 01:08:59.969
Bongsoon, stay with me today

01:09:00.386 --> 01:09:02.888
(Gookdoo) My friend Dobongsoon is a powerless woman.

01:09:02.972 --> 01:09:03.889
(Gukdu) Let's go out

01:09:04.306 --> 01:09:05.266
