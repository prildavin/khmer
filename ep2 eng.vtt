[Episode 2]

00:46.700 --> 00:51.470
Well, this is my hoobae, Jae Gyeom.

00:51.470 --> 00:53.780
You already had plans?

00:53.780 --> 00:55.460
You two should eat. Why invite me...

00:55.460 --> 00:59.250
- No, the thing-
- It's fine. I'll leave first.

00:59.250 --> 01:01.070
Excuse me.

01:01.070 --> 01:04.400
I didn't plan to meet Hyung tonight.

01:04.400 --> 01:08.000
Aren't we on a blind date tonight?

01:11.250 --> 01:12.500
Ta-da.

01:12.500 --> 01:15.310
Surprise.

01:28.210 --> 01:30.220
Are you okay?

01:31.140 --> 01:33.170
Y-Yes.

01:33.990 --> 01:35.140
The steak is...

01:35.140 --> 01:38.080
really thick.

01:38.080 --> 01:41.120
May I cut it for you?

01:42.110 --> 01:44.360
I'm asking just in case,

01:44.360 --> 01:46.880
but do you like that kind of stuff?

01:46.880 --> 01:49.500
Do you have a fetish

01:49.500 --> 01:54.200
where it has to be an ex-girlfriend
or an ex-wife of someone you know?

01:55.920 --> 01:58.870
Do such fetishes even exist?

02:01.620 --> 02:05.050
Are you asking because you have one?

02:16.650 --> 02:18.620
What? Blind date?

02:18.620 --> 02:20.610
Gosh, it's embarrassing
to think about it even now.

02:20.610 --> 02:23.460
Who would've even
thought it'd be a blind date?

02:23.460 --> 02:24.830
So you went ahead with it?

02:24.830 --> 02:26.580
What can I do, then?

02:26.580 --> 02:28.950
Should I cry on the floor and
ask how could he do that to me?

02:28.950 --> 02:32.590
Or should I filet him to
pieces with the steak knife?

02:32.590 --> 02:34.970
Why are you so extreme?

02:34.970 --> 02:38.270
You can just ask seriously why
he'd do something you didn't ask for.

02:38.270 --> 02:40.800
The mood wasn't right
for me to get serious.

02:40.800 --> 02:44.180
If I got angry, he'd say,
"Why? What did you expect?"

02:44.180 --> 02:46.250
Making me the only odd one out.

02:46.250 --> 02:49.490
He was going, "Surprise.
You like it, right?"

02:49.490 --> 02:52.400
- Overreacting and exaggerating.
- Yes, yes.

02:52.400 --> 02:56.410

[Min Jae Gyeom: You said you have a
morning consulting, right?] By the way...

03:08.140 --> 03:12.750
what's up with this weirdo who's willing to
go on a blind date with a friend's ex-wife?

03:12.750 --> 03:16.200
He's also ridiculous for
agreeing to come along.

03:16.200 --> 03:18.280
Right?

03:18.280 --> 03:20.370
He said he watches a lot of my shows,

03:20.370 --> 03:23.200
so he's been an old
fan of mine or something.

03:23.200 --> 03:28.490
And Hyung was quiet and said he knew her.

03:28.490 --> 03:30.750
I thought this is fate.

03:30.750 --> 03:33.910
So I asked him to introduce me right away.

03:33.910 --> 03:36.980
Someone he knows...

03:36.980 --> 03:39.430
Oh, I did hear later...

03:39.430 --> 03:43.350
that he knows you from having been married.

03:43.350 --> 03:46.310
But I actually lived in
the U.S. for a long time,

03:46.310 --> 03:49.650
so I'm not really repulsed by these things.

03:49.650 --> 03:52.740
Gosh, does he think he's the
only one who lived in the U.S.?

03:52.740 --> 03:54.090
Right?

03:54.090 --> 03:56.920
Unni, not everyone's cool like that,
even in the U.S., right?

03:56.920 --> 03:58.660
Come on.

03:58.660 --> 04:01.350
Hey, people are people in the U.S.

04:01.350 --> 04:03.400
There are those weirdly cool people,

04:03.400 --> 04:07.020
but some people are conservative,
like 19th-century Puritans.

04:07.020 --> 04:09.010
That's so ridiculous.

04:09.840 --> 04:11.690
So, how old is he?

04:11.690 --> 04:13.380
- 32.
- His job?

04:13.380 --> 04:14.790
He said he's a consultant.

04:14.790 --> 04:16.650
In a foreign-affiliated company.

04:16.650 --> 04:18.790
What about his looks? Is it decent?

04:18.790 --> 04:20.670
Well, he looks sane.

04:20.670 --> 04:22.970
Do you have a picture? Let me see.

Hey, date him.

- What?
- Date him! At least, sleep with him.

How can I-

04:50.030 --> 04:52.410
sleep with a man he introduced?

04:52.410 --> 04:53.600
Why can't you?

04:53.600 --> 04:57.300
It's going to feel like having
a threesome with Goo Eun Beom.

04:59.310 --> 05:02.390
Do you not like the threesome part
or having Goo Eun Beom in it?

05:02.390 --> 05:04.640
Both of them!

05:06.840 --> 05:08.700
Am I the only one who feels uneasy?

05:08.700 --> 05:15.000
Does it not matter to him if I kiss
or sleep with his close friend?

05:16.000 --> 05:18.630
You should ask him.
I'm sure he'll say this 100 percent.

05:18.630 --> 05:22.120
Two grown-ups are doing
it under mutual agreement.

05:22.120 --> 05:25.310
Isn't it weirder for the mediator
to have feelings about it?

05:25.310 --> 05:26.910
Right?

05:31.190 --> 05:33.900
That's right.

05:33.900 --> 05:37.900
This unni still has somewhat of a conservative
side, although she lived in the U.S.

05:37.900 --> 05:41.830
Don't we all know each other after six
degrees of separation in this small country?

05:41.830 --> 05:43.630
We're probably all
connected here and there.

If you keep filtering,
there's no one to date.

Not sure.

05:54.220 --> 05:56.220
How should I put this?

05:56.220 --> 05:59.700
Honestly, it's not like this

05:59.700 --> 06:04.100

to have in the office in broad daylight.

- Have you been doing well?
- Yes.

07:07.650 --> 07:10.850
Is it our first time after the wedding?

07:10.850 --> 07:12.200
I think so.

07:12.200 --> 07:14.630
- No wonder. You were in my dream last night.
- Sorry?

07:14.630 --> 07:16.230
It's a joke.

07:16.230 --> 07:17.670
Come on in.

07:18.380 --> 07:19.890
Do you work here?

07:19.890 --> 07:23.180
Where would I be working if not here?

07:23.180 --> 07:25.290
It's so nice to see you.

07:27.320 --> 07:29.200
Whoa...

07:29.200 --> 07:32.450
is Attorney Goo finally
going to fetch us a client?

07:32.450 --> 07:33.900
Seriously.

07:33.900 --> 07:36.960
I thought he'd only waste payroll.

07:38.780 --> 07:40.270
Ye Seul.

07:40.270 --> 07:41.600
Why do you look at me like that?

07:41.600 --> 07:45.620
Mr. Lion, when will you take care
of the receipt I gave you last week?

07:45.620 --> 07:47.130
Lion?

07:47.130 --> 07:48.360
Why do you call me a lion?

07:48.360 --> 07:50.740
Because you're the king
of the jungle, Mr. Sung.

07:50.740 --> 07:52.140
Jungle...

07:58.270 --> 07:59.610
Okay.

07:59.610 --> 08:02.180
I'm the only weird one again.

08:12.800 --> 08:13.840
[10:40 a.m.]

08:13.840 --> 08:16.290
She said she'll come by 10 o'clock.

Hey, Sang Eun, it's me.
Are you running late?

08:26.510 --> 08:29.420
What? You're already here?

08:30.220 --> 08:31.460
Where are you?

08:31.460 --> 08:33.140
By the way...

08:34.160 --> 08:37.570
I also have to, first off-

08:40.880 --> 08:43.150
What are you doing with my friend?

08:43.150 --> 08:46.380
You seemed to be busy,
so I welcomed her in instead.

08:46.380 --> 08:47.360
Why?

08:47.360 --> 08:49.660
Okay. Thank you.

08:49.660 --> 08:51.120
Let's go to my office.

08:51.120 --> 08:54.040
Hey, Ha Ra, you know...

08:54.040 --> 08:56.440
don't misunderstand when I say this.

08:56.440 --> 08:59.610
What misunderstanding?

09:03.750 --> 09:05.230
Wow!

09:05.230 --> 09:09.710
The only attorney who takes a case
by intercepting his ex-wife's client.

09:09.710 --> 09:12.220
Probably no one else
in the legal field of Korea.

09:12.220 --> 09:14.410
You're something else, Goo Eun Beom.

09:14.410 --> 09:17.730
Hey, what do you mean "intercept"?
Mind your word choice.

09:17.730 --> 09:21.540
We're doing it together, undoubtedly.
A joint appointment.

09:21.540 --> 09:23.680
But, hey...

09:23.680 --> 09:27.630
what's your specialty that
even we don't know about?

09:27.630 --> 09:31.510
I heard you ran your mouth to Ha
Ra's friend, saying it's your specialty.

09:31.510 --> 09:34.710
Your specialty, my ass.

09:34.710 --> 09:36.940
How can you lie so blatantly?

09:36.940 --> 09:39.480
He's not even a lawyer. Are you a fraud?

09:39.480 --> 09:41.920
Of course, it's my specialty.
Would it be yours, then?

09:41.920 --> 09:43.830
It's certainly a men's area.

09:43.830 --> 09:49.280
As a woman, could you talk about
the subtle and sensitive topic of

09:49.280 --> 09:52.360
a man's decline in sexual
function better than I can?

09:52.360 --> 09:54.600
Oh, so you're saying

09:54.600 --> 09:57.470
you're an expert on sexual dysfunction?

09:57.470 --> 09:59.500
Why? Have you recently

09:59.500 --> 10:01.840
developed a problem
down there or something?

10:01.840 --> 10:04.020
- No way.
- Nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah!

10:04.020 --> 10:06.860
What are you both talking about right now?

10:06.860 --> 10:10.200
Stop fighting and
explain the case properly.

10:10.200 --> 10:14.020
So it's a divorce case for refusing
to engage in a conjugal relationship.

10:14.020 --> 10:19.400
With an issue regarding men's
sexual dysfunction sprinkled on top.

10:19.400 --> 10:21.110
At some point,

10:21.110 --> 10:23.840
my husband won't sleep with me.

10:23.840 --> 10:26.810
Even if I send him obvious signals,

10:26.810 --> 10:29.820
he'll pretend to be
sleeping or come home late.

10:31.880 --> 10:34.460
At first, I wondered if it was my fault.

10:34.460 --> 10:37.800
Wondering if I lack
attractiveness as a woman.

11:02.700 --> 11:04.570
Darling...

11:05.590 --> 11:07.440
Darling?

11:07.440 --> 11:09.350
Oppa.

11:12.040 --> 11:15.360
Hey, Kim Mu Jin!

11:15.360 --> 11:18.460
But my pride was so bruised later.

11:19.050 --> 11:21.450
So I just gave up.

11:21.450 --> 11:24.550
How long has it been
since things have been like that?

11:24.550 --> 11:26.430
- Four years.
- What?

11:26.430 --> 11:28.540
For four years?

11:28.540 --> 11:29.730
Hey!

11:29.730 --> 11:31.460
Just divorce him. You
made the right choice.

11:31.460 --> 11:35.240
What do you lack to be
living like a widow like that?

11:35.800 --> 11:38.700
But how was it when you were dating?

11:38.700 --> 11:40.970
- Did he not like it in the first place?
- Not at all.

11:40.970 --> 11:42.380
He loved it.

11:42.380 --> 11:45.190
It was also okay during our newlywed days.

11:45.190 --> 11:47.030
But...

11:47.030 --> 11:52.270
She thinks he developed a
problem in having intercourse.

11:52.270 --> 11:54.420
So suddenly?

11:55.490 --> 11:58.020
- Was he very old?
- No, he isn't.

11:58.020 --> 11:59.490
He's only a year older than I am.

11:59.490 --> 12:02.240
Aside from age, psychological factors
also have a big influence.

12:02.240 --> 12:08.000
For example something like
a plummeting pride as a man.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.370
Plummeting pride?

12:10.370 --> 12:13.560
Is there a reason for that to happen?

12:16.640 --> 12:19.300
You know, Oppa and I
work in the same field.

12:19.300 --> 12:23.150
When I changed jobs last time,
my salary went up a lot.

12:23.150 --> 12:26.830
About two times Oppa's salary, I'd say?

12:27.650 --> 12:30.960
From then on, Oppa kept saying
these passing remarks.

12:30.960 --> 12:35.700
That he's pressured to death
because his wife is doing too well.

12:35.700 --> 12:38.720
I really thought he was joking.

12:39.870 --> 12:42.190
But no matter how I think about it...

12:42.190 --> 12:45.360
there's no other reason I can think of.

12:49.970 --> 12:52.430
How can he be so weak like a sunfish*?
(Slang for someone with a weak mind)

12:52.430 --> 12:56.340
His self-esteem plummeted
so much for such a reason?

12:56.340 --> 12:57.560
Is that really the reason?

12:57.560 --> 12:59.610
It's quite a complicated problem.

12:59.610 --> 13:01.720
It's possible.

13:01.720 --> 13:03.120
Hey, Attorney Kwon.

13:03.120 --> 13:03.920
Yes?

13:03.920 --> 13:07.530
You should be happy if your wife is
successful and makes more money.

13:07.530 --> 13:09.840
Why are you trying to side with him,
saying it's plausible?

13:09.840 --> 13:13.220
Sunbae, you wouldn't know
because you're not a man.

13:13.220 --> 13:15.400
Let's look here.

13:15.400 --> 13:20.650
An animal called a man
lives and dies by pride alone.

13:20.650 --> 13:24.660
If he lacks competence compared to
the woman he's supposed to protect, then-

13:24.660 --> 13:27.230
Protect what, exactly?

13:27.230 --> 13:30.200
Are we in the Joseon era, where the
Japanese and the barbarians invaded?

13:30.200 --> 13:32.080
If you two are going to
fight, get out and fight.

13:32.080 --> 13:34.070
Let's have the meeting, please?

13:38.320 --> 13:40.550
Let's have the meeting.

13:43.670 --> 13:46.620
Could you get a divorce verdict
for refusing a conjugal relationship?

13:46.620 --> 13:47.620
It'll be difficult.

13:47.620 --> 13:51.680
We first need to convince the husband
to proceed with divorce by agreement.

13:51.680 --> 13:54.680
- The husband is against the divorce, right?
- Yes.

13:54.680 --> 13:56.550
Absolutely against it.

13:56.550 --> 13:58.100
So it's not an affair?

13:58.100 --> 13:59.690
Exactly.

13:59.690 --> 14:02.590
My friend looked through her
husband's phone and credit card history,

14:02.590 --> 14:04.420
but there's nothing.

14:04.420 --> 14:07.520
Moreover, if he has a problem down there,

14:07.520 --> 14:10.350
I don't think he could
really have an affair.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.600
However,

14:11.600 --> 14:15.500
he could've used his phone and credit card
carefully not to get caught.

14:15.500 --> 14:18.890
Regarding intercourse, he could've
done it too diligently outside the home,

14:18.890 --> 14:21.410
so it might not work
when it's with his wife.

14:21.410 --> 14:23.520
In my opinion, this one's
adultery, 100 percent.

14:23.520 --> 14:24.590
True.

14:24.590 --> 14:26.900
You're the expert in that area.

14:26.900 --> 14:31.390
Since you're so knowledgeable about
the psychology of someone who cheats.

14:32.180 --> 14:36.380
Why don't you get on a time machine
and play the classical scholar?

14:37.120 --> 14:39.080
Okay, I'll go!

14:39.080 --> 14:40.770
Play?

14:40.770 --> 14:42.180
Are we going on a vacation?

14:42.180 --> 14:45.160
For now, keep looking
for evidence of adultery and

14:45.160 --> 14:47.160
schedule a meeting with the spouse.

14:47.160 --> 14:48.840
We need to hear his story as well.

14:48.840 --> 14:51.600
This is it for today's meeting.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.680
- Shall we go eat?
- What are you having for lunch?

14:53.680 --> 14:56.980
Go and stop Bi Chwi first.
She's going to fight all day.

14:58.300 --> 15:00.160
S-Shall we go for some food?

15:00.160 --> 15:02.820
What do you do at
night instead of sleeping?

15:09.010 --> 15:12.460
[Min Jae Gyeom: Did you have lunch?]

15:12.460 --> 15:13.900
What do I do?

15:13.900 --> 15:17.560
The guy from a blind date.
He keeps asking about our next date.

15:18.710 --> 15:19.790
It's really driving me crazy.

15:19.790 --> 15:21.710
Just meet him. Why not?

15:21.710 --> 15:24.960
Even so, I still don't feel at ease.

15:24.960 --> 15:26.210
With an acquaintance of my ex-husband.

15:26.210 --> 15:28.400
Aigoo, what a pity.

15:28.400 --> 15:30.790
He had such a great physique.

15:33.430 --> 15:38.250
If not you should really sleep with him.

15:38.250 --> 15:41.040
There you go with that nonsense again.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.130
What if Goo Eun Beom hears about it?

15:43.130 --> 15:45.960
I'm telling you, let him hear it.

15:45.960 --> 15:49.980
Sleep with him and say this.

15:49.980 --> 15:54.320
"I slept with him and...
yeah... he was good.

15:54.320 --> 15:56.650
Way better than you."

15:58.830 --> 16:02.220
You must've heard what Kwon
Si Wook was saying earlier.

16:02.220 --> 16:06.600
If men find it sensitive and delicate
enough to make them feel so fragile,

16:06.600 --> 16:09.080
you can do it, too.

16:09.080 --> 16:13.090
You should humiliate him, so he won't
be able to stick it out anywhere else.

16:13.090 --> 16:14.460
What do you say?

16:14.460 --> 16:18.490
To your mad ex-husband who dares
to introduce another man to you,

16:18.490 --> 16:21.790
isn't it such a perfect innovative revenge?

16:24.260 --> 16:27.770
I'm not sure. For me to go that far?

16:27.770 --> 16:31.050
Also, would Goo Eun Beom
even react to something like that?

16:31.050 --> 16:33.830
He's just so full of confidence.

16:35.690 --> 16:37.220
Just wait and see.

16:37.220 --> 16:40.650
Even if his heart is made of stone,

16:40.650 --> 16:43.100
probably not down there.

16:50.520 --> 16:55.900
Has it been 10 or 20 years
since you've last had intercourse?

16:56.600 --> 17:01.200
Aren't you being too impatient as a wife?

17:01.200 --> 17:05.630
I mean it'd be different if they had a kid.

17:05.630 --> 17:07.960
It's not like they're DINK or something.
In that case...

17:07.960 --> 17:11.000
isn't engagement in conjugal
relationships obligatory?

17:11.000 --> 17:13.120
DINK? What the heck is that?

17:13.120 --> 17:14.330
DINK.

17:14.330 --> 17:17.810
Double Income, No Kids.

17:17.810 --> 17:19.510
We can...

17:19.510 --> 17:24.060
have a kid through
artificial insemination, right?

17:26.650 --> 17:29.020
Sir.

17:29.020 --> 17:32.510
That's something you should consider
after attempting to resolve the

17:32.510 --> 17:36.190
fundamental problem, sexual dysfunction,
and if you fail at that.

17:36.190 --> 17:38.220
Do you know how hard it is?

17:38.220 --> 17:39.760
Look.

17:39.760 --> 17:42.970
I don't have any problem with my function.

17:42.970 --> 17:44.310
You have no idea.

17:44.310 --> 17:46.060
- Is that so?
- Yes.

17:46.060 --> 17:47.400
You have no problem in functioning?

17:47.400 --> 17:48.620
No, not at all.

17:48.620 --> 17:51.590
Did Sang Eun slander you
without any grounds, then?

17:51.590 --> 17:55.060
- These people are being so rude-
- Come on.

17:57.700 --> 18:00.830
By the way, do the two of you know this?

18:00.830 --> 18:06.270
Our country is number one in
the world for sexless marriages.

18:06.270 --> 18:09.000
We're busy trying
to make a living these days, right?

18:09.000 --> 18:12.940
Attorney, that isn't normal, though.

18:12.940 --> 18:16.730
Are you going to insist they accept it
since the statistics say so?

18:17.550 --> 18:19.690
Then how many times...

18:19.690 --> 18:23.800
do ordinary married couples
need to have sex per week?

18:23.800 --> 18:28.800
Attorney Oh, how many
times do you do it per week?

18:30.090 --> 18:31.740
Huh?

18:32.770 --> 18:34.550
Huh?

18:40.640 --> 18:43.700
Gosh, he's such a perverted nutcase.

18:43.700 --> 18:47.710
He dares to sexually harass an opposing
attorney he met for the first time?

18:47.710 --> 18:50.890
I should've recorded it and sued him.

18:50.890 --> 18:53.130
Even if you sued him,
these things are vague.

18:53.130 --> 18:54.770
There you go again.

18:54.770 --> 18:57.450
Judge Goo Eun Beom strikes again.

18:57.450 --> 18:58.800
Didn't I tell you all the time?

18:58.800 --> 19:03.000
If you're not going to relate,
then just be quiet, please.

19:05.960 --> 19:07.430
Are you working overtime today?

19:07.430 --> 19:09.240
Do you want to grab dinner?

19:09.240 --> 19:12.390
There's the spicy cold noodle place here.

19:12.390 --> 19:14.380
The one we used to go to often.

19:18.060 --> 19:20.050
What dinner, out of the blue?

19:20.050 --> 19:22.070
- I'm fine.
- Why?

19:22.070 --> 19:25.470
You need to eat spicy
stuff when you're stressed.

19:26.870 --> 19:28.510
I have a dinner plan.

19:28.510 --> 19:29.990
I see.

19:29.990 --> 19:32.030
With Min Jae Gyeom.

19:37.400 --> 19:41.310
He's not bad, right? Now
that you've talked to him.

19:41.900 --> 19:44.820
I thought you'd be able to talk to him.

19:44.820 --> 19:47.950
You said you like a man you can talk to.

19:48.750 --> 19:51.250
That was so long ago.

19:52.310 --> 19:53.610
Talk?

19:53.610 --> 19:55.690
Why would I talk to a man?

19:55.690 --> 19:58.000
Unless it's talking with my body.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.100
Talking with your body?

20:02.600 --> 20:05.700
Your values became very proactive.

20:05.700 --> 20:07.930
Well, thanks to you know who.

20:07.930 --> 20:09.170
Wait...

20:09.170 --> 20:11.280
you mean, me?

20:11.280 --> 20:15.010
What did I do exactly?

20:18.070 --> 20:21.790
Oh, no. What I mean is...

20:22.480 --> 20:25.190
After living with someone like you, I had

20:25.190 --> 20:28.700
lost interest in conversations
with the opposite sex.

20:28.700 --> 20:32.470
It's not like I suddenly opened my eyes
because you excelled in something.

20:32.470 --> 20:36.100
Whoa, that's why...

20:36.100 --> 20:39.760
That's why you began to
actively engage in body talk?

20:39.760 --> 20:41.080
Wait...

20:41.080 --> 20:42.810
Why is our talk going in that direction?

20:42.810 --> 20:44.880
It's not like that. Not at all.

20:44.880 --> 20:46.160
Don't have any weird thoughts.

20:46.160 --> 20:48.760
What thoughts am I having?

20:51.820 --> 20:53.030
It's not.

20:53.030 --> 20:56.260
- Your face is turning red-
- I said it's not!

21:13.380 --> 21:15.460
How was dinner tonight?

21:16.410 --> 21:19.010
Yes, well...

21:19.010 --> 21:21.580
The mackerel sashimi was
exceptionally good, right?

21:22.560 --> 21:26.300
It reminded me of the
mackerel I had in Jeju-do.

21:26.300 --> 21:28.670
Their mackerel stew was great.

21:28.670 --> 21:30.130
Whoa...

21:30.130 --> 21:33.890
I'd have to go all the way to Jeju-do
to feed you what you like.

21:34.910 --> 21:36.590
Well, it's no big deal. We'll go.

21:36.590 --> 21:39.470
Let's go to Jeju-do
sometime for mackerel stew.

21:39.470 --> 21:41.820
I've been to Jeju-do a few times.

21:41.820 --> 21:43.810
I thought it was great every time I went.

21:43.810 --> 21:46.200
The ocean and the sky...

21:46.200 --> 21:48.820
It had a kind of foreign vibe.

21:49.710 --> 21:51.810
If we go to Jeju-do...

21:51.810 --> 21:53.800
will we be sleeping there?

21:53.800 --> 21:56.340
- Sorry?
- Of course, we will, right?

21:56.340 --> 21:59.800
It's not like we'll be making
a day trip for mackerel stew.

21:59.800 --> 22:03.520
I'm not sure. I don't think it's a
necessarily required condition.

22:03.520 --> 22:05.310
There's no need to go...

22:06.630 --> 22:09.750
all the way to Jeju-do to sleep.

22:09.750 --> 22:12.690
I'm okay with it even tonight.

22:12.690 --> 22:14.270
Deal?

22:17.420 --> 22:20.000
I guess you don't like me.

22:20.000 --> 22:24.060
I like you, Ha Ra, but you don't have to
force yourself to see me if you don't want to.

22:24.060 --> 22:26.930
I don't make it a hobby to ask a man
I don't like to sleep with me.

22:26.930 --> 22:30.920
You're not asking to sleep with me
because you like me, right?

22:36.840 --> 22:38.820
You're smart and...

22:38.820 --> 22:41.470
your face is handsome.

22:41.470 --> 22:43.330
You probably have many women around you.

22:43.330 --> 22:46.860
You don't intend to have a
serious relationship with me, either.

22:46.860 --> 22:50.480
Ha Ra, you're also pretty,
smart, and awesome.

22:50.480 --> 22:53.250
Although it sounds like
an inferiority complex,

22:53.250 --> 22:55.920
I have a flaw, to be frank.

22:55.920 --> 22:58.000
You've never been married.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.800
I'm a divorcee.

23:03.480 --> 23:04.940
Perhaps...

23:04.940 --> 23:07.620
did you make a bet with
Goo Eun Beom or something?

23:07.620 --> 23:10.200
To be rewarded if you seduce me?

23:13.380 --> 23:14.880
Well...

23:14.880 --> 23:18.760
I'm not sure if this is the
right thing to say here,

23:18.760 --> 23:21.770
but my mother remarried three times.

23:21.770 --> 23:25.090
I'm not saying I understand you, but...

23:25.090 --> 23:29.690
it also doesn't mean my mother has a flaw.

23:35.420 --> 23:37.120
Well...

23:40.480 --> 23:43.650
The mackerel sashimi we had tonight...

23:44.670 --> 23:46.750
was delicious.

23:48.170 --> 23:49.690
Same here.

24:00.090 --> 24:02.950
Thank you for driving me home.

24:02.950 --> 24:04.400
Not at all.

24:04.400 --> 24:05.840
Please take care.

24:05.840 --> 24:07.870
I had fun tonight.

24:10.120 --> 24:12.000
You know...

24:15.760 --> 24:19.080
can I drop the honorifics
next time when we meet?

24:19.080 --> 24:21.790
You can say no to dropping the honorifics,

24:21.790 --> 24:25.530
but I hope you won't say no to meeting
again*. (Spoken without honorifics)

24:28.620 --> 24:30.880
Okay.

24:30.880 --> 24:32.480
Yes!

24:38.010 --> 24:40.590
Since I granted your favor, Jae Gyeom,

24:40.590 --> 24:42.900
could I also ask you for a favor?

24:42.900 --> 24:44.690
Sure. Anything.

24:45.620 --> 24:47.440
You said anything just now.

24:47.440 --> 24:49.450
You can't dodge it, okay?

24:55.160 --> 24:57.180
N-No, we can't.

24:59.970 --> 25:02.410
Whoa, daebak.

25:02.410 --> 25:05.370
I guess he seriously didn't want to.

25:05.370 --> 25:07.000
Right?

25:07.000 --> 25:11.630
Unless he seriously didn't want to,
he couldn't have done that, right?

25:11.630 --> 25:12.650
It hurts my pride.

25:12.650 --> 25:14.600
This isn't about your pride hurting.

25:14.600 --> 25:18.350
How do I put it...
It's about respect for the mackerel or...

25:18.350 --> 25:20.420
What I mean is...

25:20.420 --> 25:24.420
There are people who don't like to kiss
without brushing their teeth.

25:26.200 --> 25:29.950
But still, I took great courage
to approach him like that.

25:29.950 --> 25:32.110
How can he dodge that?

25:32.970 --> 25:34.280
Okay.

25:34.280 --> 25:37.160
Try to avoid mackerels from now on.

25:37.160 --> 25:39.020
I'm going on ahead.

25:43.390 --> 25:45.730
[Min Jae Gyeom]

25:53.790 --> 25:56.500
You can't do that. You
shouldn't skip meals.

25:56.500 --> 25:58.600
Do you want to go eat
something delicious next time?

25:58.600 --> 26:02.980
Hey, I guess that gentleman
doesn't loath you as a filthy woman

26:02.980 --> 26:06.900
when you came onto him
without brushing your teeth.

26:06.900 --> 26:09.510
He's a decent person in many ways.

26:09.510 --> 26:11.720
No bias as well.

26:11.720 --> 26:13.430
Aigoo, you're both so diligent.

26:13.430 --> 26:14.910
Hi.

26:14.910 --> 26:17.180
- Welcome.
- Have you eaten?

26:17.180 --> 26:19.860
Yes, of course, we did.

26:21.290 --> 26:23.260
Did you have a good date?

26:23.260 --> 26:25.540
Of course, I did. You
think I wouldn't have?

26:25.540 --> 26:26.990
A date? What date?

26:26.990 --> 26:28.140
Don't you know?

26:28.140 --> 26:32.220
Goo introduced his friend to Oh.

26:32.220 --> 26:33.500
What?

26:33.500 --> 26:35.260
- You crazy-
- Why?

26:35.260 --> 26:37.640
It must be great to be you...

26:37.640 --> 26:40.790
since you have many
people to spit on your grave.

26:40.790 --> 26:43.550
The grass will probably
grow without a problem.

26:43.550 --> 26:46.250
Should I spit on your
grave if you want, CEO Seo?

26:46.250 --> 26:47.320
Shit!

26:48.280 --> 26:49.900
Everyone's here, right?

26:49.900 --> 26:51.380
Hello.

26:51.380 --> 26:52.680
Hello.

26:52.680 --> 26:55.230
Inquiry of financial transaction details...

26:55.230 --> 26:57.790
inquiry of international travel records...

26:57.790 --> 26:59.760
and inquiry about call details.

26:59.760 --> 27:01.110
Gosh...

27:02.310 --> 27:05.000
I don't know if they'll
accept all of these.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.140
But why did you leave out
the sexual dysfunction issue?

27:08.140 --> 27:09.760
During the meeting,

27:09.760 --> 27:12.900
it was bothering me a little bit

27:12.900 --> 27:17.520
how the husband was trembling,
saying that it was not true.

27:17.520 --> 27:20.700
It's hard to prove in the first place,
and if it turns out that he's fine,

27:20.700 --> 27:22.360
we just give them a reason to-

27:22.360 --> 27:24.500
The tables will turn in their favor.

27:24.500 --> 27:29.900
So, you plan to pressure them
by bombarding them with inquiries first?

27:29.900 --> 27:31.400
Right.

27:31.400 --> 27:35.000
I'm disapproving all
of the inquiry requests.

27:36.700 --> 27:39.100
What do we do then? Am I doomed?
I can't divorce him?

27:39.100 --> 27:40.430
No.

27:40.430 --> 27:43.810
That's why we also
just used the last resort.

27:46.030 --> 27:50.030
In fact, we also have something
to add to the cause of the suit.

27:50.030 --> 27:54.060
There's one more imputation on the
defendant, Kim Mu Jin, Your Honor.

27:54.060 --> 27:55.770
Besides refusing to engage
in conjugal relationships?

27:55.770 --> 27:56.640
Yes.

27:56.640 --> 28:00.460
His reason for refusing to engage in
conjugal relationships has been specified.

28:00.460 --> 28:02.190
What is the reason?

28:02.190 --> 28:04.690
We suspect Defendant Kim Mu Jin...

28:05.680 --> 28:09.040
to be suffering a severe
sexual dysfunction.

28:09.040 --> 28:10.690
A sexual dysfunction?

28:10.690 --> 28:14.090
The plaintiff is currently
suspecting her husband

28:14.090 --> 28:17.520
is avoiding intercourse because
he developed sexual dysfunction.

28:19.260 --> 28:21.010
I see.

28:21.010 --> 28:25.080
Refusing intercourse can't be a reason
for divorce, but sexual dysfunction can?

28:25.080 --> 28:27.680
You should've used that as the
reason for divorce in the first place.

28:27.680 --> 28:29.190
But the thing is...

28:29.190 --> 28:31.710
proving that issue is quite problematic.

28:31.710 --> 28:34.290
Because of the burden of proof.

28:34.290 --> 28:36.640
What is that?

28:36.640 --> 28:39.200
To put it simply,

28:39.200 --> 28:44.010
in the end, a trial is
similar to a game of tennis.

28:44.010 --> 28:46.310
While you're hitting the ball over the net,

28:46.310 --> 28:48.854
you're telling each
other to prove their point.

28:48.854 --> 28:52.879
And if one side misses the
ball and fails to prove their point,

28:52.879 --> 28:54.579
then that side loses.

28:55.590 --> 28:56.880
So that means...

28:56.880 --> 29:00.600
it's our turn to prove
the claim we put out.

29:00.600 --> 29:03.740
Your Honor, to prove
his sexual dysfunction,

29:03.740 --> 29:07.810
I'd like the defendant to submit his
urology examination results to the court.

29:07.810 --> 29:09.750
Could I request a discovery, please?

29:09.750 --> 29:11.000
Whoa...

29:11.000 --> 29:13.990
I said my client doesn't
have sexual dysfunction.

29:13.990 --> 29:17.100
You're determined to humiliate this man.

29:17.100 --> 29:22.000
Your Honor, it's inevitable for
people to have a difference in libido,

29:22.000 --> 29:24.980
but they're trying to find
one flaw by abusing requests.

29:24.980 --> 29:26.900
You mustn't allow that!

29:26.900 --> 29:31.270
Also, although my client
doesn't have an issue down there,

29:31.270 --> 29:32.740
to add to my argument,

29:32.740 --> 29:36.830
sexual dysfunction is a temporary
problem that can be treated.

29:36.830 --> 29:38.900
So it can't serve as a reason for divorce.

29:38.900 --> 29:44.800
In short, I'm saying there's any reason
to accept the request for discovery.

29:46.500 --> 29:51.290
Of course, a treatable, temporary problem
is not a reason for divorce.

29:51.290 --> 29:55.220
But if he does have sexual dysfunction,
yet he neglected treatment

29:55.220 --> 29:57.950
and didn't fulfill his duty to his spouse,

29:57.950 --> 29:59.960
then this becomes a problem.

29:59.960 --> 30:02.560
So, if the defendant brings
his urology examination results,

30:02.560 --> 30:04.900
everything will become clear.

30:04.900 --> 30:08.940
Your Honor, if his sexual
dysfunction is proven,

30:08.940 --> 30:13.500
it will also prove that the defendant, who has
continuously denied and avoided the matter,

30:13.500 --> 30:19.700
hasn't been fulfilling his duty
of integrity between a married couple.

30:29.270 --> 30:31.060
Yes!

30:35.590 --> 30:39.000
I think it's better for the
defendant to get tested.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.860
For an efficient progression
of the trial, please cooperate.

30:42.860 --> 30:44.400
Yes, Your Honor.

30:55.730 --> 30:58.560
Gosh, what a relief.

30:58.560 --> 31:01.220
Then we just need the test results?

31:01.220 --> 31:02.930
But...

31:03.820 --> 31:07.290
there are still two problems with that.

31:07.290 --> 31:09.540
What problems?

31:09.540 --> 31:10.660
First,

31:10.660 --> 31:13.790
discovery isn't mandatory but encouraged.

31:13.790 --> 31:15.530
If they insist on not doing it,

31:15.530 --> 31:19.240
then we have no way of forcing them.

31:19.240 --> 31:20.870
Second,

31:20.870 --> 31:23.990
if they do the test...

31:23.990 --> 31:26.180
and it's not sexual dysfunction...

31:26.180 --> 31:27.020
If it's not?

31:27.020 --> 31:30.560
There's a chance he could be fine
when getting tested at the hospital.

31:30.560 --> 31:32.260
If it's psychology-related anyway,

31:32.260 --> 31:35.810
it might be a problem with
your relationship. In that case,

31:35.810 --> 31:39.050
sexual dysfunction will be harder to prove.

31:47.980 --> 31:49.550
What about you?

31:49.550 --> 31:51.210
What are you doing?

31:51.210 --> 31:53.710
You claimed to be an
expert in male problems.

31:53.710 --> 31:56.930
You should contribute something, too.

31:56.930 --> 31:59.460
You insisted it was a 100 percent affair,

31:59.460 --> 32:01.410
but you haven't discovered anything.

32:01.410 --> 32:02.110
- Well...
- She's right.

32:02.110 --> 32:03.610
She's right.

32:03.610 --> 32:06.980
I agreed to the joint appointment because
you said a man knows men's issues.

32:06.980 --> 32:09.500
But I don't really see your merit.

32:09.600 --> 32:11.580
Sang Eun, you can't be so quick to judge.

32:11.580 --> 32:13.850
You can't be so quick to judge.

32:13.850 --> 32:15.520
For now...

32:20.040 --> 32:24.090
For now, should I meet with your husband?

32:24.090 --> 32:25.850
Then what? What will you do?

32:25.850 --> 32:27.290
I'll convince him.

32:27.290 --> 32:29.990
If you want to win, just take the test.

32:29.990 --> 32:32.130
No, don't get the test.

32:32.130 --> 32:33.810
You...

32:33.810 --> 32:36.710
You do know what you're saying, right?

32:36.710 --> 32:38.740
Yes, of course.

32:39.230 --> 32:42.620
Sang Eun, could you give me
your husband's phone number?

32:42.620 --> 32:45.590
For now, I'll-

32:45.590 --> 32:50.200
You better not make this harder
by meeting him and provoking him.

32:50.200 --> 32:52.650
You're dead meat, then.

32:52.650 --> 32:54.370
Got it?

33:00.850 --> 33:02.600
Thank you.

33:09.920 --> 33:11.830
Have some.

33:13.570 --> 33:17.930
Why are you bothering me
at work when I'm so busy?

33:17.930 --> 33:22.190
Sir, the reason I asked
to meet with you today

33:22.190 --> 33:27.120
was to give you some
honest advice, man to man.

33:27.790 --> 33:32.630
Sir, will you do the sexual function test?

33:32.630 --> 33:34.640
Why? You said I should.

33:34.640 --> 33:36.550
Did your attorney tell you to?

33:36.550 --> 33:40.680
Wait... why should I tell you that?

33:40.680 --> 33:42.270
Did you come here to sound it out?

33:42.270 --> 33:47.100
Sir. I just want to help you.

33:47.100 --> 33:49.340
You don't know...

33:49.340 --> 33:53.000
how hurtful that can be to a man's soul.

33:53.000 --> 33:56.650
That exam is more
difficult than you'd expect.

33:56.650 --> 33:58.990
Do you know how it's done?

33:59.700 --> 34:01.200
I'm very familiar with it.

34:01.200 --> 34:04.520
My previous client has done it before.

34:04.520 --> 34:07.000
Well, so...

34:07.000 --> 34:11.230
the reason why it's difficult...

34:11.230 --> 34:16.130
The consultation makes you feel so
ashamed by asking such detailed questions.

34:16.130 --> 34:19.650
Do you know how mortifying that exam is?

34:19.650 --> 34:22.270
Angle test, hormone test,

34:22.270 --> 34:26.100
and be admitted overnight to make sure
there's no problem in the early morning...

34:26.100 --> 34:27.800
On top of that,

34:29.060 --> 34:33.220
they also perform a rigidity test and etc.

34:36.030 --> 34:38.350
So what I want to say is...

34:38.350 --> 34:42.900
avoid a traumatic experience
trying to prove you're healthy.

34:42.900 --> 34:47.180
Instead of discovery, move on to an
adjustment and quickly draw an agreement...

34:47.180 --> 34:50.550
So, you're telling me to divorce her?

34:50.550 --> 34:53.470
The judge will rule in
favor of divorce, anyway.

34:53.470 --> 34:58.290
The court wouldn't like it if you ignored
them when it requested a discovery.

34:58.290 --> 35:00.200
So, should you have the exam?

35:00.200 --> 35:02.150
You get scared when you're getting tested.

35:02.150 --> 35:05.700
Even the healthiest
men, out of nervousness,

35:05.700 --> 35:08.020
they can't get it up when it really should.

35:12.710 --> 35:15.740
If you take the exam
and still end up divorcing,

35:15.740 --> 35:18.410
the verdict will blatantly
state you divorced...

35:18.410 --> 35:20.910
because of sexual dysfunction.

35:20.910 --> 35:24.970
In that case, you might
have to pay alimony as well.

35:27.040 --> 35:28.900
Sir...

35:29.970 --> 35:30.790
Yes.

35:30.790 --> 35:34.030
Do you know why I'm going to this extent?

35:34.030 --> 35:35.060
Of course not.

35:35.060 --> 35:37.290
I feel it's a shame.

35:37.290 --> 35:40.760
I know very well...

35:40.760 --> 35:43.180
where you're coming from.

35:47.370 --> 35:49.950
That thing, you know...

35:49.950 --> 35:52.360
Other people would never know.

35:56.550 --> 36:01.110
Wow... there are all sorts
of divorce lawsuits, huh?

36:01.110 --> 36:03.230
This isn't even the worst.

36:03.230 --> 36:06.750
There are so many more ridiculous cases.

36:06.750 --> 36:10.270
That's why I try not to file
complaints outside of work.

36:10.270 --> 36:11.930
Why?

36:12.540 --> 36:15.550
Because fighting is work for me.

36:15.550 --> 36:17.750
In writing and at the court, too,

36:17.750 --> 36:21.200
always arguing, "I'm
right, and you're wrong."

36:21.660 --> 36:25.310
It must make you think
since they're all divorce cases.

36:26.280 --> 36:30.160
You only listen to many people's
stories about their breakups.

36:30.800 --> 36:35.590
You must not have any fantasies
about marriage and love.

36:35.590 --> 36:37.400
Even if I'm not a divorce lawyer,

36:37.400 --> 36:42.440
am I not too old to
have fantasies like that?

36:42.440 --> 36:44.820
Do you have that, Jae Gyeom?

36:45.400 --> 36:48.820
Well, I can't say that I don't.

36:49.500 --> 36:53.070
I have a fantasy about a complete family.

36:53.070 --> 36:55.220
Since I never had one.

36:56.020 --> 36:57.990
If I get to create a family,

36:57.990 --> 37:02.020
I'm confident I can cherish
it more than anything I have.

37:03.100 --> 37:08.800
Of course, there's no guarantee it'll be
perfect just because I'll be cherishing it.

37:13.300 --> 37:17.000
I sound too childish now
that I'm talking about it.

37:18.190 --> 37:22.060
I think you're pure, Jae Gyeom.

37:22.060 --> 37:24.350
Is that a compliment or an insult?

37:25.690 --> 37:27.830
It's a secret.

37:32.050 --> 37:35.040
Oh, right. Why didn't
you drop the honorifics?

37:35.040 --> 37:38.160
You declared so happily last time.

37:40.880 --> 37:42.380
O-Okay*.
(Spoken without honorifics)

37:42.380 --> 37:44.500
I will.

37:44.500 --> 37:47.470
But what about your answer to my question?

37:48.550 --> 37:51.220
Is it a compliment or an insult?

37:53.030 --> 37:55.780
It's a total...

37:57.510 --> 37:58.790
a compliment.

37:58.790 --> 38:00.360
Gosh.

38:05.260 --> 38:08.990
It's nice to drop... honorifics, isn't it?

38:08.990 --> 38:11.060
Jae Gyeom.

38:11.060 --> 38:13.960
Y-Yes, it's nice to...

38:13.960 --> 38:17.620
drop honorifics, Ha Ra.

38:17.620 --> 38:19.160
Gosh.

38:19.160 --> 38:20.630
It was so fun tonight.

38:20.630 --> 38:22.160
Me, too.

38:22.160 --> 38:23.830
I'll be going.

38:26.660 --> 38:28.580
Ha Ra...

38:56.500 --> 38:58.710
Oh, w-wait.

38:58.710 --> 39:03.350
Well... let's stop here today.

39:03.350 --> 39:05.150
Why?

39:21.420 --> 39:25.200
My heart's starting to flutter.

39:25.200 --> 39:26.980
So tell me...

39:26.980 --> 39:30.760
is he... a good kisser?

39:30.760 --> 39:33.080
Very.

39:34.000 --> 39:37.070
What a relief. I don't need to lie.

39:37.070 --> 39:39.120
You know, Goo Eun Beom.

39:39.120 --> 39:42.400
You need to tell him Jae Gyeom
is way better than him

39:42.400 --> 39:44.850
to deflate that ego of his. Aren't I right?

39:44.850 --> 39:46.690
But you suck at lying.

39:46.690 --> 39:50.000
He'll catch on if you tell him a lousy lie.

39:51.030 --> 39:53.490
I'll catch on to what?

39:56.760 --> 39:58.460
It's nothing.

39:58.460 --> 40:01.510
I got a call from Kim Mu
Jin's attorney just now.

40:01.510 --> 40:02.700
Did you get a call, too?

40:02.700 --> 40:05.260
No, not yet. Why?

40:10.820 --> 40:13.510
I'm Goo Eun Beom.

40:15.060 --> 40:17.740
You said you have a problem down there?

40:17.740 --> 40:19.400
Of course.

40:19.400 --> 40:23.880
That much lie seemed
needed to build some rapport.

40:25.180 --> 40:27.000
You're crazy.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.350
Whoa, hey! What the-

40:29.350 --> 40:30.900
What the?

40:30.900 --> 40:32.620
What... What's happening?

40:32.620 --> 40:34.660
Hold on.

40:34.660 --> 40:36.130
There it goes again.

40:36.130 --> 40:39.240
You can just pull the lever on the side.

40:39.240 --> 40:40.120
Where?

40:40.120 --> 40:43.910
It keeps breaking down
since I bought it dirt cheap.

40:43.910 --> 40:46.300
Hold on. I'll fix it at the next red light.

40:46.300 --> 40:49.470
Hey, did this car get
flooded before or something?

40:49.470 --> 40:51.620
Did you do your research before buying it?

40:51.620 --> 40:56.730
Flooded cars... aren't always bad.

40:59.680 --> 41:01.420
Hold on.

41:06.710 --> 41:08.420
Okay.

41:13.570 --> 41:15.600
One, two, three.

41:15.600 --> 41:18.700
One, two, three.

41:19.480 --> 41:22.090
Geez, why isn't it working?

41:22.090 --> 41:24.320
One, two...

41:25.530 --> 41:28.600
Okay, one, two...

41:30.700 --> 41:33.010
Gosh. Hold on.

41:33.010 --> 41:34.990
Hold on.

41:44.610 --> 41:47.980
Hey, just take the subway.

41:47.980 --> 41:50.310
You want to risk your
life on this lousy car?

41:50.310 --> 41:53.430
Why? Does it worry you?

41:53.430 --> 41:56.550
If you're worried, you could
decrease the alimony money.

41:56.550 --> 41:59.090
So I can buy a car through
installment payments.

41:59.090 --> 42:01.520
Just take the subway.

42:29.400 --> 42:33.000
I think it's that woman.

42:34.200 --> 42:36.400
- Who?
- Ki Seo Hee.

42:37.400 --> 42:40.100
- You didn't see her?
- I didn't.

42:45.050 --> 42:47.190
Was I mistaken?

43:04.170 --> 43:06.970
Whenever I look at you,

43:06.970 --> 43:11.220
I feel that karma really does exist.

43:11.220 --> 43:16.300
Who knew you'd end up
like this when we divorced?

43:16.300 --> 43:21.000
You probably believed you'd start
a new, happy life with your first love.

43:21.000 --> 43:25.600
You had no clue your mom would
take your studio and amend her will.

43:27.600 --> 43:29.090
I couldn't...

43:29.090 --> 43:32.570
fathom how you could be
fine with Jae Gyeom and me

43:32.570 --> 43:34.980
hitting it off, but...

43:34.980 --> 43:38.150
now I think I can understand you.

43:38.150 --> 43:42.080
I used to tremble with anger when I
thought about that woman, Ki Seo Hee.

43:42.080 --> 43:43.690
But now...

43:43.690 --> 43:44.960
I just think...

43:44.960 --> 43:48.130
that was terrible of her.

43:48.130 --> 43:51.000
Shouldn't she take responsibility
if she stole you from me?

43:51.000 --> 43:53.500
I wonder if she even has a conscience.

43:55.300 --> 43:58.100
Don't we truly seem like friends now?

44:06.090 --> 44:07.650
Sorry.

44:12.350 --> 44:16.430
Her betrayal knows no bounds!

44:17.430 --> 44:18.760
Did you read it?

44:18.760 --> 44:21.050
Did you read everything?

44:21.050 --> 44:24.330
How could a woman be so thick-skinned, huh?

44:24.330 --> 44:26.480
She's the one who cheated,

44:26.480 --> 44:29.000
so she makes a big
deal out of their sex life,

44:29.000 --> 44:32.290
and goes crazy about a divorce. Geez.

44:32.290 --> 44:36.230
I knew something was odd from the get-go.

44:36.230 --> 44:38.010
Sang Eun, is this...

44:38.010 --> 44:40.110
really true?

44:41.620 --> 44:43.960
Go ahead and try denying it.

44:44.870 --> 44:46.980
I'll show you something worse.

44:47.940 --> 44:51.260
Is the other party aware? That you're...

44:51.260 --> 44:52.750
filing for divorce?

44:53.810 --> 44:55.140
Yes.

44:56.070 --> 44:58.840
He says he'll take care
of me once I get divorced.

44:59.850 --> 45:02.160
Is he married or single?

45:02.160 --> 45:03.360
He's single.

45:03.360 --> 45:05.320
You and he both are...

45:05.320 --> 45:07.610
not in your right minds.

45:09.050 --> 45:10.360
What does he do?

45:10.360 --> 45:12.600
He's still a student.

45:12.600 --> 45:15.300
- He's young.
- By how many years?

45:15.300 --> 45:18.000
- 10 years.
- He's 25 years old?

45:21.080 --> 45:23.000
He says he's confident

45:23.000 --> 45:25.120
he can make me happy if I get divorced.

45:25.120 --> 45:26.720
Sang Eun...

45:27.650 --> 45:30.370
do you really believe that?

45:30.370 --> 45:32.300
He's 25 years old!

45:32.300 --> 45:37.480
Do you really believe what a 25-year-old kid
says to a married woman 10 years his senior?

45:38.400 --> 45:40.690
I believe him.

45:40.690 --> 45:42.310
I love him.

45:42.310 --> 45:44.320
Gosh...

45:44.320 --> 45:46.020
Goodness...

45:46.020 --> 45:47.550
Are you really Yim Sang Eun?

45:47.550 --> 45:50.220
Are you the Yim Sang Eun I know?

45:50.220 --> 45:51.380
You...

45:51.380 --> 45:52.720
Y-You've gone mad.

45:52.720 --> 45:54.220
You're not in your right mind.

45:54.220 --> 45:55.910
Ha Ra,

45:55.910 --> 45:58.740
my decision to get
divorced isn't because of him.

45:58.740 --> 46:00.410
That's not what I intended at first.

46:00.410 --> 46:02.510
- While preparing for the divorce-
- Then?

46:02.510 --> 46:05.610
If that's the case, then you
should've told me earlier.

46:05.610 --> 46:08.950
How in the world do you
expect me to trust you now?

46:08.950 --> 46:11.010
I wanted to tell you, too.

46:11.010 --> 46:12.980
But I couldn't!

46:12.980 --> 46:15.990
I'm embarrassed of myself, too.

46:20.170 --> 46:22.110
I felt empty.

46:24.120 --> 46:26.510
I also questioned...

46:26.510 --> 46:28.780
why I should go on living.

46:36.420 --> 46:39.090
[Dating]

46:40.520 --> 46:43.660
I met him through an app.

46:43.660 --> 46:46.140
My life was so dull,

46:46.140 --> 46:48.920
so I kept having bad thoughts.

46:50.570 --> 46:52.560
But Ha Ra...

46:52.560 --> 46:56.370
that person made me want to live again.

46:56.370 --> 46:57.870
He told me...

46:57.870 --> 47:01.480
he can definitely make me happy,
no matter what others say.

47:01.480 --> 47:04.230
He tells me he loves me every day.

47:04.230 --> 47:07.370
He says I'm so lovely he could die.

47:08.290 --> 47:10.960
But do you know how I felt...

47:10.960 --> 47:13.680
when I heard him say that?

47:15.520 --> 47:18.540
I also deserve to be loved.

47:19.420 --> 47:22.390
I'm still a desirable person.

47:23.570 --> 47:26.830
I wasn't the one with fault.

47:41.870 --> 47:44.170
Many people will...

47:44.170 --> 47:45.820
judge you.

47:45.820 --> 47:47.380
You know that, right?

47:49.330 --> 47:51.620
But...

47:51.620 --> 47:54.940
as long as you can
endure that, it's okay...

47:54.940 --> 47:57.050
to break up.

47:57.050 --> 48:00.360
Every decision comes at a price.

48:01.420 --> 48:03.150
But also...

48:03.150 --> 48:07.610
every decision comes with a payoff.

48:14.620 --> 48:16.230
Oh, boy...

48:28.550 --> 48:30.680
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to take a cab.

48:30.680 --> 48:32.280
Why?

48:40.830 --> 48:43.270
You asshole. You jerk!

48:43.270 --> 48:45.050
W-What's wrong with you?

48:45.050 --> 48:46.340
What?

48:46.340 --> 48:48.960
"As long as you can endure that...

48:48.960 --> 48:51.710
it's okay to break up"?

48:51.710 --> 48:54.840
You're practically an
adultery consultant now.

48:54.840 --> 48:57.000
You could soothe the hearts of all the

48:57.000 --> 48:59.670
adulterers in the world!

49:02.310 --> 49:04.270
Asshole.

49:30.060 --> 49:31.790
Sir.

49:36.600 --> 49:38.000
What did you want to discuss?

49:38.000 --> 49:42.560
Well, I got divorced two years ago because

49:42.560 --> 49:45.210
my husband cheated on me.

49:45.210 --> 49:48.260
Did Sang Eun ever tell you this?

49:48.260 --> 49:50.600
No, she didn't.

49:50.600 --> 49:52.100
I see.

49:52.100 --> 49:54.400
Well, to put it bluntly,

49:54.400 --> 49:57.590
I was once in your shoes.

49:57.590 --> 49:59.460
Stabbed in the back by...

49:59.460 --> 50:01.020
a cheating bastard.

50:01.020 --> 50:02.070
Gosh.

50:03.030 --> 50:04.710
As someone who's been there,

50:04.710 --> 50:07.250
- let me tell you, straightforw-
- Excuse me.

50:07.250 --> 50:09.730
Please don't.

50:09.730 --> 50:11.300
I'm never getting a divorce.

50:11.300 --> 50:15.300
Sir, what do you have to gain
by devoting your life to revenge?

50:15.300 --> 50:19.540
I tried all that, so I know.
You won't become happier by doing that.

50:19.540 --> 50:20.730
Taking revenge...

50:20.730 --> 50:24.290
- doesn't make you happier
by ruining her life... Revenge?

50:24.290 --> 50:26.950
You think I'm doing this for revenge?

50:29.380 --> 50:31.550
I just want Sang Eun to come back to me.

50:31.550 --> 50:34.220
I still love...

50:34.220 --> 50:36.320
Sang Eun.

50:36.320 --> 50:37.870
Wait...

50:37.870 --> 50:39.960
it doesn't add up.

50:39.960 --> 50:42.260
If you love Sang Eun, why did you neglect-

50:42.260 --> 50:44.080
Let me ask you this.

50:44.080 --> 50:46.400
Do you have to have
sex a lot to signify love?

50:46.400 --> 50:49.190
Love means having lots of sex?

50:49.190 --> 50:51.090
No. Nope.

50:51.090 --> 50:53.500
Not necessarily, but...

50:53.500 --> 50:56.900
there's also no reason
not to if you love her.

51:00.940 --> 51:02.800
I would if I could.

51:02.800 --> 51:05.370
- You think I'm choosing not to?
- Wait, Sir.

51:05.370 --> 51:08.150
Then acknowledge your
sexual dysfunction and get treat-

51:08.150 --> 51:11.490
How many times do I
have to tell you it's not that?

51:19.730 --> 51:21.100
Sir-I mean...

51:21.100 --> 51:23.900
Mu Jin, so...

51:23.900 --> 51:27.430
you want to, but you can't
because you can't get it up,

51:27.430 --> 51:33.610
society has agreed to diagnose
that as sexual dysfunction.

51:35.090 --> 51:38.110
I don't have a problem with my function.

51:38.110 --> 51:40.900
There's a reason I can't.

51:40.900 --> 51:43.160
You don't even know.

51:44.230 --> 51:45.740
What is it?

51:45.740 --> 51:48.990
It's okay. You can tell me, honestly.

51:50.450 --> 51:52.380
I take medicine for...

51:54.030 --> 51:56.450
Hair loss?

51:56.450 --> 51:57.840
So...

51:57.840 --> 52:01.370
that medicine is what
caused a problem down there.

52:01.370 --> 52:04.890
That's why he's been claiming
he doesn't have sexual dysfunction.

52:04.890 --> 52:08.040
He couldn't admit it, which
is why he was so frustrated.

52:08.040 --> 52:10.720
Why couldn't he admit it?

52:10.720 --> 52:12.840
"I'm suffering the side effect
of hair loss medication."

52:12.840 --> 52:15.910
He could just be honest and
stop taking the medication.

52:15.910 --> 52:17.750
Did someone force him to take it?

52:17.750 --> 52:21.360
Well, I listened to his story and...

52:21.360 --> 52:24.070
I feel sorry for him.

52:24.070 --> 52:26.930
I mean, his wife changed
jobs and is doing well,

52:26.930 --> 52:28.940
but he can't even get a promotion.

52:28.940 --> 52:31.120
He was stressed about this and that,

52:31.120 --> 52:33.420
when even his hair started to fall out.

52:33.420 --> 52:37.190
He felt the need to
protect at least his hair.

52:37.190 --> 52:40.790
But to salvage his social reputation
and save face with his wife,

52:40.790 --> 52:44.850
"Could I choose my hair over our sex life?"

52:44.850 --> 52:47.620
He couldn't bring himself to ask her that.

52:47.620 --> 52:50.230
Because it hurt his pride.

52:50.230 --> 52:52.990
Man, isn't it heartbreaking?

52:52.990 --> 52:55.850
You consider that heartbreaking?

52:55.850 --> 52:58.850
I consider that to be crazy selfish.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.120
- Huh?
- Welcome.

53:03.120 --> 53:04.300
What the?

53:04.300 --> 53:07.000
Whoa, how nice. The meat's all cooked.

53:07.000 --> 53:08.730
Let's eat together.

53:08.730 --> 53:10.440
Gosh, what's up...

53:10.440 --> 53:11.900
You pay the bill.

53:11.900 --> 53:14.500
Eat. How much could you eat?

53:16.350 --> 53:17.950
Pass me a spoon.

53:22.790 --> 53:24.060
So...

53:24.060 --> 53:26.900
how does he plan to proceed?

53:26.900 --> 53:28.520
What?

53:28.520 --> 53:30.110
Sang Eun.

53:30.110 --> 53:32.100
I met her husband.

53:33.020 --> 53:37.120
I mean, I could understand
him until this point,

53:37.120 --> 53:40.180
but things start to get
ridiculous from here.

53:41.740 --> 53:44.430
- Mu Jin.
- Yes?

53:44.430 --> 53:46.910
I really don't think this is right.

53:46.910 --> 53:49.350
You should tell her directly.

53:49.350 --> 53:51.230
How much you love Sang Eun,

53:51.230 --> 53:53.360
and how you want to
work things out with her.

53:53.360 --> 53:56.140
You should tell her
directly with all your heart.

53:56.140 --> 53:58.320
Why should I deliver the message to her?

53:58.320 --> 54:00.860
Attorney Oh, I'm really not that eloquent.

54:00.860 --> 54:03.220
I feel like I'll just be more pitiful, so-

54:03.220 --> 54:05.830
How would you live with her then?

54:05.830 --> 54:07.800
If you can't even
explain your own feelings,

54:07.800 --> 54:10.310
how will you live
together? It'd be frustrating.

54:11.300 --> 54:15.670
Well, no matter how
important physical connection is

54:15.670 --> 54:19.830
you'll never stay together if you
can't communicate your feelings.

54:19.830 --> 54:22.920
Communicate your feelings for
now, and when the atmosphere is right,

54:22.920 --> 54:24.330
and when the atmosphere is right,

54:24.330 --> 54:27.700
start attempting to connect physically.

54:27.700 --> 54:30.950
She'll probably connect with you
better than that guy she just met

54:30.950 --> 54:33.890
who's still wet behind the ears.

54:33.890 --> 54:35.790
Don't you think so?

54:35.790 --> 54:37.380
Probably, right?

54:38.760 --> 54:40.300
Come on.

54:40.300 --> 54:41.770
- Fighting!
- Yes.

54:41.770 --> 54:43.360
I'll do my best.

54:43.360 --> 54:44.780
Go on.

54:44.780 --> 54:46.120
Okay.

54:48.950 --> 54:50.990
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

54:56.760 --> 54:59.450
What is communication?

55:01.160 --> 55:03.430
What is hair loss?

55:04.620 --> 55:07.350
It's a matter directly related to pride.

55:07.350 --> 55:09.460
A man's hair count that is.

55:09.460 --> 55:11.680
Hey, of course.

55:11.680 --> 55:13.710
I feel sorry for that husband.

55:13.710 --> 55:16.700
- Imagine how inferior he-
- Gosh!

55:16.700 --> 55:19.330
I hate men with inferiority complexes.

55:19.330 --> 55:20.900
They disgust me!

55:20.900 --> 55:23.180
Sunbae, is there any man you don't hate?

55:23.180 --> 55:24.330
Does he even exist?

55:24.330 --> 55:27.620
You always complain about this and that.

55:27.620 --> 55:31.220
What is he saying?

55:31.220 --> 55:32.400
Hey.

55:32.400 --> 55:34.130
I'm...

55:34.130 --> 55:38.040
crazy about men who don't
have inferiority complexes,

55:38.040 --> 55:42.510
are handsome and have
healthy minds and bodies.

55:42.510 --> 55:43.990
Where will you find a man like that?

55:43.990 --> 55:45.910
That's why you're still single-

55:45.910 --> 55:47.930
- Wait, wait.
- Give me a shot.

55:47.930 --> 55:49.520
I heard that. I heard that.

55:50.600 --> 55:53.300
You take that back.

55:53.300 --> 55:56.240
I could've married if I set my mind to it.

55:56.240 --> 55:58.600
But I didn't, not couldn't!

55:58.600 --> 56:00.900
- Are you sure?
- Shit, this bastard...

56:00.900 --> 56:02.670
Put that down.

56:02.670 --> 56:04.230
Come on!

56:04.230 --> 56:05.300
Put that down now.

56:05.300 --> 56:09.130
How are you two more hostile
than the divorced couple?

56:09.130 --> 56:10.690
That's enough.

56:10.690 --> 56:12.300
Let me drink in peace.

56:12.300 --> 56:14.340
Don't you know why?

56:15.300 --> 56:20.040
They like each other's
shells but hate their insides.

56:20.040 --> 56:22.100
That makes them mad.

56:22.100 --> 56:23.570
What?

56:23.570 --> 56:24.850
What?

56:24.850 --> 56:27.310
Hey, how could you say that?

56:27.310 --> 56:29.610
I told you it was a secret.

56:31.010 --> 56:32.570
It was a secret?

56:32.570 --> 56:34.910
That he looks like Sunbae's ex-boyfriend?

56:34.910 --> 56:36.760
Hey!

56:36.760 --> 56:38.330
All right, all right.

56:38.330 --> 56:40.860
All right! Stop those outbursts.

56:40.860 --> 56:42.190
What is he saying?

56:42.190 --> 56:43.970
Your ex-boyfriend looks like me?

56:43.970 --> 56:45.560
Nope.

56:48.720 --> 56:50.800
What the hell, Kwon Si Wook?

56:50.800 --> 56:53.200
- He's happy.
- Who?

56:53.200 --> 56:55.390
- Kwon Si Wook is happy!
- Hey!

56:55.390 --> 56:57.060
This guy...

56:57.060 --> 56:59.800
About three days after joining the company,

56:59.800 --> 57:02.230
- he was lovesick.
- Hey!

57:02.230 --> 57:05.690
If you hadn't cursed him out
for not calling you sunbae,

57:05.690 --> 57:07.330
he would've even confessed to you.

57:07.330 --> 57:08.750
Hey.

57:10.810 --> 57:12.200
Huh?

57:12.200 --> 57:14.870
Spewing nonsense every
time you open your mouth.

57:14.870 --> 57:16.320
Hey,

57:16.320 --> 57:17.950
lettuce is expensive these days.

57:17.950 --> 57:19.150
What are you saying?

57:19.150 --> 57:21.180
I hate it. Absolutely hate it.

57:21.180 --> 57:22.540
- Auntie...
- I hate it.

57:22.540 --> 57:23.960
Auntie!

57:32.600 --> 57:34.670
Hey, Sang Eun.

57:37.920 --> 57:39.340
What?

57:41.410 --> 57:42.920
Hey,

57:42.920 --> 57:45.040
are you sure you won't regret this?

57:45.040 --> 57:46.290
Who knows?

57:46.290 --> 57:48.900
I might end up regretting this.

57:48.900 --> 57:53.650
But every decision comes with a price.

57:53.650 --> 57:56.990
If regret is the cost,
then I have no choice.

57:56.990 --> 57:59.090
Ha Ra.

58:02.890 --> 58:04.570
The key.

58:22.830 --> 58:25.430
Mr. Kim Mu Jin...

58:25.430 --> 58:28.910
no longer wants to meet the other party.

58:28.910 --> 58:32.090
Let's just quickly proceed with
the adjustments by ourselves.

58:32.090 --> 58:36.680
I'll apply for the earliest
date for adjustments.

58:36.680 --> 58:38.160
Aigoo,

58:38.160 --> 58:40.030
how bittersweet.

58:40.030 --> 58:42.730
No matter how many times
I go through divorce cases,

58:42.730 --> 58:47.270
it feels bitter when
they end up breaking up.

58:49.510 --> 58:51.470
And...

58:51.470 --> 58:53.220
just among us...

58:53.220 --> 58:56.240
isn't your friend being too harsh...

58:56.240 --> 58:58.100
over their sex life?

58:58.100 --> 59:01.970
Is sex that important to women these days?

59:01.970 --> 59:04.890
Are you like that, too, Attorney Oh?

59:04.890 --> 59:06.590
Huh?

59:06.590 --> 59:07.650
Huh?

59:07.650 --> 59:09.350
Look here-

59:12.680 --> 59:14.250
Ahjussi,

59:16.020 --> 59:17.190
if...

59:18.200 --> 59:20.090
there's a problem with your package,

59:20.090 --> 59:23.500
how about getting treatment at a hospital?

59:24.390 --> 59:26.510
Even if you claim depression,

59:26.510 --> 59:29.520
paranoia, or mental and physical
weakness due to sexual dysfunction,

59:29.520 --> 59:31.220
we won't negotiate...

59:31.220 --> 59:34.380
your settlement money out of pity.

59:35.210 --> 59:37.200
The transcript of...

59:37.200 --> 59:41.870
a conversation with the direct participation
of the involved party isn't illegal evidence.

59:41.870 --> 59:43.510
You know that, right?

59:44.800 --> 59:48.430
You didn't win your law license by playing
Go-Stop, did you? (Korean card game)

1:00:15.570 --> 1:00:18.060
I'm curious about something.

1:00:18.060 --> 1:00:19.930
About what?

1:00:19.930 --> 1:00:22.040
To be honest,

1:00:22.040 --> 1:00:24.790
I lived without thinking about you.

1:00:24.790 --> 1:00:28.590
I had zero interest in what you were up to

1:00:28.590 --> 1:00:30.820
or who you met with.

1:00:30.820 --> 1:00:32.720
But...

1:00:32.720 --> 1:00:34.940
now you're curious?

1:00:42.630 --> 1:00:45.160
What are you curious about?

1:00:45.160 --> 1:00:47.810
I wonder about...

1:00:47.810 --> 1:00:52.110
the deciding factor that made you
choose to abandon me for that woman.

1:00:53.220 --> 1:00:55.120
That's what I'm curious about.

1:01:11.500 --> 1:01:13.480
- Did something happen?
- Oh...

1:01:14.660 --> 1:01:17.630
No, nothing happened.

1:01:19.110 --> 1:01:20.670
Gosh,

1:01:20.670 --> 1:01:23.870
I must be tired since it's Friday.

1:01:23.870 --> 1:01:25.970
Should we go home if you're tired?

1:01:25.970 --> 1:01:27.260
Should we?

1:01:27.260 --> 1:01:28.750
If it's okay with you...

1:01:28.750 --> 1:01:30.400
we can go to my house.

1:01:30.400 --> 1:01:33.030
You know, since it's the weekend.

1:01:49.620 --> 1:01:51.530
Ki Seo Hee...

1:02:15.180 --> 1:02:17.170
♫ I was fine ♫

1:02:17.170 --> 1:02:19.580
Attorney Oh Ha Ra against
Attorney Goo Eun Beom.

1:02:19.580 --> 1:02:23.220
How could the same firm represent
both defendant and the plaintiff?

1:02:23.220 --> 1:02:25.120
- Pardon me.
- Let's mind our manners.

1:02:25.120 --> 1:02:27.630
Don't you know a battle
for custody means war?

1:02:27.630 --> 1:02:30.180
Do you plan to keep cutting me off?

1:02:30.180 --> 1:02:31.380
You cut us off first.

1:02:31.380 --> 1:02:33.200
- Defendant Representative!
- Yes!

1:02:33.200 --> 1:02:36.410
- Let's just kill him.
- That sounds better, right?

1:02:36.410 --> 1:02:40.170
I don't think I got over Goo Eun Beom.

1:02:40.170 --> 1:02:44.240
I think Ha Ra still isn't over you, Hyung.

1:02:44.240 --> 1:02:48.210
