WEBVTT

00:00:44.277 --> 00:00:45.445

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:47.580
It's my daughter. She has acute leukemia.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.856
Mr. Taesan, just go get a blood test.

00:00:58.558 --> 00:00:59.759

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:04.964

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:06.332
Promise.

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.111
I scheduled surgery for the 26th.

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:20.613
I'll definitely come, don't worry.

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:22.382
If you don't want to give it a whole year

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:24.551
with millions of dollars What is lost must be wasted.

00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:26.586
You must be at the venue two hours early.

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:30.123
Today, MP Joe and President Moon Please come to my house.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.592
I set up the camera like you told me to.

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.527
I don't know if I can record it.

00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:37.630
Hey, it's Jang Tae Sun.

00:01:37.697 --> 00:01:39.866
Don't worry about it, it's just trash.

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:42.202
Sir, please pawn this one.

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:43.436
Hurry.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.139
Oh Mi Suk told me to go find him.

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:48.508
Oh Mi Suk

00:02:29.716 --> 00:02:30.583
What is this?

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:32.385
what happened

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:38.892
There is a tucked away.

00:02:43.196 --> 00:02:44.931
There is a tucked away.

00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:47.600
There is a tucked away.

00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:53.973
- Stop - Don't move.

00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:57.911
Listen first, I just...

00:03:02.448 --> 00:03:03.449
Put the knife down

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:04.951
Put the knife down

00:03:10.223 --> 00:03:12.125
It's not like that, I...

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:13.993
I didn't...

00:03:14.961 --> 00:03:16.129
Wait a minute.

00:03:17.497 --> 00:03:19.265
Wait, I didn't do it.

00:03:19.332 --> 00:03:20.533
Shut up.

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:22.302
I didn't do it.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.905
I'll survive.

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:29.008
God didn't take me away.

00:03:29.075 --> 00:03:30.910
Because God knows right and wrong.

00:03:30.977 --> 00:03:32.545
It's already certain.

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:35.381
Hey there, good boy.

00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:38.151
But what about the donor who will save Sujin's life?

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:40.153
Who is this?

00:03:42.755 --> 00:03:44.390
They don't tell each other's names in this matter.

00:03:45.858 --> 00:03:48.695
That donor saved my life.

00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:50.730
If you say it again it will be 100 times already.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.665
Let's just say, I'll sit and listen until 1,000 times.

00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:56.169
When I finished surgery I get to eat ice cream and chocolate.

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:57.437
hamburger

00:03:57.704 --> 00:03:59.339
And what else, Mom?

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:01.674
Saimai, Candy, Ramyun

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:03.776
I can eat everything.

00:04:03.843 --> 00:04:05.678
Mom said she would buy everything for me.

00:04:05.778 --> 00:04:09.782
I will be a football player, a writer, an illustrator, and I will sell dolls.

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.050
And then...

00:04:11.117 --> 00:04:13.119
Then uncle would buy me a ball.

00:04:13.186 --> 00:04:15.388
I'll take you to an amusement park. Go to the aquarium

00:04:15.455 --> 00:04:18.157
I'll take you to see the scary fish. that catches people and eats them as food

00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:22.996
Wait a minute.

00:04:25.865 --> 00:04:26.966
I carried it myself.

00:04:27.133 --> 00:04:28.234
Im Seungwoo.

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:32.171
What? Why do you have to let me go to work?

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:35.141
I've taken a break.

00:04:35.742 --> 00:04:38.544
No, I don't know what. But tell him to handle it.

00:04:39.045 --> 00:04:40.079
look for

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:42.849
You're acting unreasonably.

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:46.819
A murder case?

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.358
- Stay still - I'll go crazy.

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:54.427
I said I didn't do it.

00:04:55.328 --> 00:04:57.964
Sir, I received a call and went there.

00:04:58.331 --> 00:05:00.633
When I got there, an unknown person hit me on the head.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.869
Put the knife in my hand and ran away.

00:05:04.837 --> 00:05:06.739
Why don't you listen to what people say?

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:08.775
Senior, what about his socks?

00:05:08.841 --> 00:05:10.510
- You take it off. - Me?

00:05:10.943 --> 00:05:13.179
You just do it. Why do I have to endure smelling my smelly feet?

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:14.881
Don't touch it.

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:17.950
That doll

00:05:18.384 --> 00:05:21.087
There's no metal. Just a stuffed doll.

00:05:21.854 --> 00:05:24.057
Try touching it to see if there is metal inside.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:25.658
Acting like you know too much

00:05:25.725 --> 00:05:27.126
Let's dissect it and see if there's any medicine.

00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:29.195
Don't pass.

00:05:29.962 --> 00:05:32.398
Bring it, bring it back.

00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:38.705
Became a policeman Can you destroy other people's things?

00:05:39.405 --> 00:05:42.642
By the way, I didn't come because I was caught dealing drugs.

00:05:42.975 --> 00:05:44.610
I was not arrested on drug charges.

00:05:45.445 --> 00:05:47.647
Why would you come and dissect the stomach of a doll that doesn't know anything?

00:05:48.047 --> 00:05:49.282
Do the police have no hands?

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:53.119
You can use your hands to touch and rub it.

00:05:53.252 --> 00:05:56.022
How dare this bastard talk nonsense about low and high places?

00:05:58.157 --> 00:06:00.326
This is my personal thing.

00:06:00.893 --> 00:06:03.363
And, I'm still a suspect.

00:06:03.596 --> 00:06:06.733
I won't let you Seize personal property like this.

00:06:07.233 --> 00:06:08.601
If you don't agree, then why?

00:06:12.238 --> 00:06:14.107
I will sue for human rights violations.

00:06:14.173 --> 00:06:15.775
Senior

00:06:16.275 --> 00:06:18.811
He sued us for Can you have human rights?

00:06:23.683 --> 00:06:26.319
This bastard has lost his mind.

00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:40.967
I'm sorry I called you while I was with my family.

00:06:41.033 --> 00:06:42.101
Do you know who the victims are?

00:06:42.168 --> 00:06:44.270
It's a woman named Oh Mi Suk, 26 years old.

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:45.872
The culprit was caught at the scene.

00:06:46.105 --> 00:06:48.007
He has been jailed for assault twice.

00:06:49.375 --> 00:06:51.310
- The suspect - Has he been arrested?

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:52.545
Are you disappointed that you got caught?

00:06:52.612 --> 00:06:54.414
Once caught, why would you call me to come immediately?

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.416
It only refused in one way.

00:06:56.482 --> 00:06:58.484
The scene of the crime was extremely horrifying.

00:06:59.018 --> 00:07:00.052
So?

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.723
Senior, time has arrived on the scene.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:05.124
What must I do first?

00:07:05.191 --> 00:07:06.292
Do you fall asleep while studying?

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:07.894
It's not like that.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.063
I just happened to be here. The scene of the first murder

00:07:11.564 --> 00:07:13.332
- Did you bring your camera? - Yes.

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:45.865
The emotions were so intense that they were frightening. Is one stab not enough?

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.002
Ildo, come take a close-up photo.

00:07:55.508 --> 00:07:57.477
Closer again

00:08:15.895 --> 00:08:17.864
One team is looking at the Mullae district case.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.166
- I'll let you look at the case. - Understood, sir.

00:08:20.933 --> 00:08:22.602
Got a partner just being a new kid

00:08:22.702 --> 00:08:25.137
Let him do his miscellaneous work. Because we have already caught the criminal.

00:08:25.204 --> 00:08:26.272
yes

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:31.010
I'm sorry, senior.

00:08:31.644 --> 00:08:34.313
Normally, my stomach is very upset.

00:08:34.647 --> 00:08:37.049
When I was in high school I had friends. Come spit on ramyun.

00:08:37.116 --> 00:08:39.185
- I still drink until... - That's enough.

00:08:39.585 --> 00:08:40.653
I'm going to puke too.

00:08:40.887 --> 00:08:44.190
Then he was in front of a corpse covered in blood. How can you do this without being shaken?

00:08:45.725 --> 00:08:48.928
Blood is like the tears of a victim.

00:08:49.061 --> 00:08:49.929
Are you tears?

00:08:49.996 --> 00:08:52.265
It's a way to shed tears. Ask for justice from us.

00:08:56.903 --> 00:08:58.938
But what about that beast? What's its name?

00:08:59.405 --> 00:09:00.439
Jang Tae Sun

00:09:00.506 --> 00:09:02.074
Eight years ago, he spent two years in prison.

00:09:02.241 --> 00:09:03.576
Five years ago it was 18 months in a row.

00:09:03.843 --> 00:09:05.745
Let me see what its face looks like.

00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:07.713
Let's go investigate its history.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:08.848

00:09:37.944 --> 00:09:39.712
- I'm sorry, it's... - Name

00:09:40.346 --> 00:09:41.347
I said it wasn't me.

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:42.415
name

00:09:43.849 --> 00:09:45.051
Jang Tae Sun

00:09:46.886 --> 00:09:48.187
- Age - Thirty-two

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:50.456
ID card number 821224-1052510

00:09:51.691 --> 00:09:54.026
By the way, how is it?

00:09:54.393 --> 00:09:56.596
Dead? Is she dead?

00:09:56.729 --> 00:09:59.131
- Occupation - I asked if there was a miscarriage.

00:09:59.198 --> 00:10:00.232
occupation

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:11.043
Pawn shop manager

00:10:11.744 --> 00:10:13.779
Overseas pawnshop name I told you already, did you know?

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.215
Located in an alley around Yeongdeungpo.

00:10:17.683 --> 00:10:19.685
But it's a little too much for you.

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:23.990
Why won't you tell me if she survived or not? I'm asking because I'm worried.

00:10:25.992 --> 00:10:27.560
Then why did you come to ask me?

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.262
So who should I ask?

00:10:30.363 --> 00:10:32.131
I'm asking because you went there.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.735
Why did you kill her?

00:10:37.703 --> 00:10:38.938
Is there anything hidden?

00:10:42.842 --> 00:10:44.143
It's not me.

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:46.479
I didn't kill Mi Suk.

00:10:47.213 --> 00:10:49.849
Why do you think it's me? Even though we didn't listen at all.

00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:54.353
No, I just went because Mi Suk called to say I was sick.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:56.489
Please let me stop by at your house.

00:10:57.289 --> 00:10:58.891
- Did you call? - Yes, I called.

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:07.366
You guys are incredible.

00:11:08.601 --> 00:11:09.735
Is it really a police detective?

00:11:09.935 --> 00:11:12.471
And remember this too. that I am the suspect

00:11:12.538 --> 00:11:14.006
Don't act like a criminal.

00:11:14.073 --> 00:11:15.041
No.

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:17.576
Can't act like I'm the defendant.

00:11:17.977 --> 00:11:20.513
By the way, I have witnesses as well.

00:11:21.647 --> 00:11:22.782
What are you calling?

00:11:23.149 --> 00:11:25.451
Why did Oh Mi Suk call me?

00:11:26.252 --> 00:11:29.255
Tae San hyung left at 11 o'clock and never came back.

00:11:29.488 --> 00:11:30.723
Didn't you go back at all?

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:33.192
Go look at the security cameras. We can get it at the pawn shop.

00:11:33.259 --> 00:11:35.995
I heard you told Jang Tae Sun. Didn't you go to the warehouse in Paju?

00:11:46.272 --> 00:11:48.140
You, here.

00:11:51.844 --> 00:11:53.245
You stupid girl.

00:11:54.046 --> 00:11:55.614
How did you end up like this?

00:11:59.151 --> 00:12:01.587
What kind of bastard did that to her?

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:13.499
So why did it take so long?

00:12:13.999 --> 00:12:14.900
How do you say it?

00:12:14.967 --> 00:12:16.368
Is it a single digit IQ?

00:12:16.635 --> 00:12:18.838
Think of Jo Drae Yong and Jang Suk.

00:12:18.904 --> 00:12:22.241
I'll catch the exit. Can you go along with what you lied to?

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:26.145
Did they really say that?

00:12:26.712 --> 00:12:29.281
Dae-yong and Seok-du say Did I really not go back to the pawn shop?

00:12:29.982 --> 00:12:31.484
Said Mi Suk didn't call too?

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:32.651
Two of them gave evidence.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.554
The document has been signed.

00:12:35.621 --> 00:12:36.922
(Record the testimony of the witness)

00:12:40.793 --> 00:12:43.462
Call back, call those bastards back.

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:46.699
They're lying.

00:12:47.266 --> 00:12:50.302
Actually, they said she called.

00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:52.438
So I went to Mi Suk's house.

00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:55.875
Listen to me, policeman.

00:12:55.941 --> 00:12:57.743
I really have a witness.

00:12:58.244 --> 00:12:59.645
- The warehouse in Paju? - Yes.

00:13:00.246 --> 00:13:02.314
There are CCTV cameras there. Go check it out.

00:13:02.381 --> 00:13:05.151
That warehouse moved. Since last month already

00:13:05.217 --> 00:13:07.319
What are you moving today?

00:13:08.053 --> 00:13:10.489
I'm still going. I haven't moved a bit.

00:13:22.334 --> 00:13:25.504
Detective Kim, have you checked out the warehouse on Road 704 yet?

00:13:26.238 --> 00:13:28.774
The warehouse is empty. There's nothing.

00:13:29.208 --> 00:13:30.376
Are you sure the warehouse is empty?

00:13:30.609 --> 00:13:31.911
There's nothing at all?

00:13:32.311 --> 00:13:33.779
Go see if there are cameras outside.

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:43.155
There aren't any security cameras.

00:13:43.355 --> 00:13:45.825
People around here say The warehouse has been vacant since last month.

00:13:48.027 --> 00:13:49.228
Thank you very much.

00:13:52.865 --> 00:13:53.866
You've heard it, right?

00:13:54.233 --> 00:13:55.534
impossible

00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:58.971
I'm sure you went to the right place.

00:13:59.738 --> 00:14:02.208
Daeryong actually told me to go there.

00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:07.346
You can check the call log on my mobile phone.

00:14:07.513 --> 00:14:10.382
He said he called. Because you disappeared and refused to return.

00:14:11.317 --> 00:14:12.451
I'll call you to hurry back.

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:16.589
Then hurry to the warehouse in Paju. Go get some things for me.

00:14:16.655 --> 00:14:18.324
Please go visit.

00:14:18.924 --> 00:14:21.227
It might be heavy. I saw you cry a lot.

00:14:21.794 --> 00:14:24.864
Jo Daeryong, Daeryong's skill.

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:26.632
It was her who killed her.

00:14:27.266 --> 00:14:30.135
Daeyong killed her and blamed it on me.

00:14:30.202 --> 00:14:31.503
And what about Jang Suk?

00:14:32.471 --> 00:14:33.706
what?

00:14:34.607 --> 00:14:37.710
I think it's a murder case. Is it like a normal case?

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:40.012
I think you can slander each other. Just because someone asked you to?

00:14:41.747 --> 00:14:45.084
It's true, why did Seok Du lie?

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:46.151
Jang Tae Sun

00:14:46.218 --> 00:14:48.354
Wait, please give me some time.

00:14:52.157 --> 00:14:54.627
You left the pawn shop at 11 o'clock.

00:14:54.693 --> 00:14:57.029
and was arrested at Mr. Oh Mi Suk's house at 3:30 p.m.

00:14:57.229 --> 00:14:58.330
What did you do during that time?

00:14:59.498 --> 00:15:00.633
I went to the hospital.

00:15:00.699 --> 00:15:01.800
A hospital?

00:15:03.135 --> 00:15:04.703
Do you really think I killed Oh Mi Suk?

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:10.843
Why would I do something like that today?

00:15:12.244 --> 00:15:13.913
Which hospital and why?

00:15:16.815 --> 00:15:17.950
What time do you come out?

00:15:18.183 --> 00:15:22.054
I mean, it's pretty complicated.

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:26.659
The truth is I...

00:15:28.394 --> 00:15:31.096
Someone who can control both Daeyong and Seok-Du.

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:33.265
There is only one Moon Il Suk.

00:15:34.533 --> 00:15:37.770
(Eight years ago, Busan)

00:15:42.174 --> 00:15:44.743
If you get caught, the worst hit is only two years.

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:47.279
But if my son gets hit Must have been for seven to eight years.

00:15:47.579 --> 00:15:48.847
Can't it really be like that?

00:15:59.625 --> 00:16:02.461
I heard news that during this time

00:16:02.528 --> 00:16:04.563
He's dating a woman.

00:16:11.437 --> 00:16:14.373
Let me take you two. Let's eat our last meal together at the sea.

00:16:15.607 --> 00:16:17.443
And throw both of them into the sea?

00:16:22.915 --> 00:16:24.550
I don't want it.

00:16:25.517 --> 00:16:27.019
I will go to jail.

00:16:28.954 --> 00:16:31.724
Or will I go to jail again?

00:16:32.858 --> 00:16:35.394
Are you sure?

00:16:37.363 --> 00:16:38.464
understand

00:16:39.431 --> 00:16:42.801
Detective Park hasn't contacted you yet? Has he gone to look at the camera at the pawn shop yet?

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:46.105
The camera didn't change the tape. It's been a month already.

00:16:46.372 --> 00:16:47.339
Is it a month?

00:16:49.174 --> 00:16:50.709
I just changed it yesterday.

00:16:51.076 --> 00:16:52.678
Stop lying, you son of a bitch.

00:16:57.016 --> 00:17:00.619
Female MP's fan club website hits 200,000 members in six months

00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:03.389
It is truly a phenomenon.

00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:06.425
- People like her... - Why hasn't he called again?

00:17:06.759 --> 00:17:09.094
From the campaign policy that was successful...

00:17:09.595 --> 00:17:12.765
MP Joe lives in a 600 square foot house in Hongjae District.

00:17:12.831 --> 00:17:15.067
which has been rented for these six years

00:17:15.401 --> 00:17:18.737
The former also has a name as a lawyer. that helps minority groups in society

00:17:18.904 --> 00:17:22.641
At the end of this month she will hold an auction.

00:17:22.975 --> 00:17:25.944
For the social welfare center to be established in Incheon

00:17:26.011 --> 00:17:29.014
I also heard that She called an art collector in England.

00:17:29.348 --> 00:17:31.483
No decision yet How will I investigate the case?

00:17:31.884 --> 00:17:33.052
Let's go in depth.

00:17:33.318 --> 00:17:37.022
This afternoon a murder case occurred. at Yeongdeungpo District

00:17:37.556 --> 00:17:39.858
The victim is a 26-year-old woman.

00:17:39.925 --> 00:17:43.762
Died after being stabbed dozens of times.

00:17:44.096 --> 00:17:47.299
Police arrested the 32-year-old assailant at the scene.

00:17:47.366 --> 00:17:53.238
(A few days before Oh Mi Suk's death)

00:18:11.056 --> 00:18:12.491
I'll go outside.

00:18:27.739 --> 00:18:29.975
Boss Oh, it's me.

00:18:30.976 --> 00:18:33.178
I'd like you to help me investigate something.

00:18:33.846 --> 00:18:34.880
(Day of incident)

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:36.648
Want to expand your pawn shop?

00:18:38.117 --> 00:18:40.018
- Chief Hwang - Yes.

00:18:40.419 --> 00:18:43.589
I'm on duty. Since when do you take care of their business?

00:18:43.655 --> 00:18:45.023
What the fuck?

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:48.260
I saw this and asked to come and talk to the president.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.395
The person who came here to ask is just to ask for you.

00:18:50.462 --> 00:18:51.964
Let's expand the pawn shop.

00:18:52.197 --> 00:18:53.999
It's not like that.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.836
I'm here about Jang Tae Sun.

00:18:59.304 --> 00:19:00.339
Jang Tae Sun?

00:19:00.606 --> 00:19:03.942
Yes, Mr. President. I really want to expand my business.

00:19:04.042 --> 00:19:05.611
But I couldn't do it because of that brother.

00:19:05.878 --> 00:19:09.515
I've heard that the president owes him something.

00:19:10.315 --> 00:19:11.884
So I couldn't do anything.

00:19:13.252 --> 00:19:15.854
- Stuck? - Who said something like that?

00:19:15.921 --> 00:19:17.222
That matter has passed as a nation.

00:19:17.356 --> 00:19:20.359
But I think he's holding his neck out because of this. The pawn shop didn't care.

00:19:20.626 --> 00:19:22.961
Keep gambling Always messing with girls

00:19:24.696 --> 00:19:27.866
Among the women he messed with There is a person named Mi Suk.

00:19:28.333 --> 00:19:30.335
She is head over heels in love with Jang Tae Sun.

00:19:33.772 --> 00:19:36.842
- Who? - The honest-faced girl named Mi Suk?

00:19:37.242 --> 00:19:40.546
I don't know how to flirt. But she comes to see Jang Tae Sun every day.

00:19:40.612 --> 00:19:42.047
What the hell is this?

00:19:44.183 --> 00:19:45.384
Chief Hwang

00:19:45.651 --> 00:19:47.986
What nonsense is he talking about? Pull out that tongue now.

00:19:48.387 --> 00:19:49.655
This guy

00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:53.759
- Mr. President - What?

00:19:53.892 --> 00:19:55.360
MP

00:19:55.627 --> 00:19:57.162
Senator Joe called.

00:20:03.502 --> 00:20:05.270
So can I leave a message?

00:20:06.104 --> 00:20:07.773
Very important matter

00:20:07.839 --> 00:20:10.342
When can I contact the prosecutor? I have to tell her immediately.

00:20:11.677 --> 00:20:12.878
Please tell me.

00:20:13.312 --> 00:20:17.049
Said I miss you. Said I miss you.

00:20:17.649 --> 00:20:18.917
I have to tell her.

00:20:23.288 --> 00:20:25.857
This is Moon Il Suk.

00:20:26.258 --> 00:20:30.195
Not just sleeping with Park Jae Young's line.

00:20:30.295 --> 00:20:31.897
But he still took me to his house.

00:20:48.313 --> 00:20:49.414
President

00:21:01.593 --> 00:21:03.495
Where are you going?

00:21:04.429 --> 00:21:05.364
is...

00:21:05.564 --> 00:21:06.732
I...

00:21:06.798 --> 00:21:10.736
Selling my story to Prosecutor Park Jae Young So you're thinking of running away?

00:21:16.275 --> 00:21:17.409
you...

00:21:18.644 --> 00:21:20.979
Do you know that I gave my heart to you?

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:22.981
Really go

00:21:24.116 --> 00:21:26.018
I know.

00:21:26.752 --> 00:21:27.986
Did you know?

00:21:29.921 --> 00:21:33.025
And until now

00:21:33.258 --> 00:21:35.727
Are you my girl?

00:21:36.061 --> 00:21:37.396
I...

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:42.167
Pretending to love me to take advantage of me Go tell the prosecutor?

00:21:45.003 --> 00:21:48.006
I don't have a choice.

00:21:50.742 --> 00:21:51.777
really?

00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:55.247
Is that so?

00:21:57.349 --> 00:21:58.950
How dare you?

00:21:59.584 --> 00:22:01.853
Let's play with Moon Il Seok's heart.

00:22:03.322 --> 00:22:04.489
She dares...

00:22:07.859 --> 00:22:09.094
Dare to play with me

00:22:09.761 --> 00:22:11.496
Dare to play with Moon Il Seok's heart.

00:22:23.508 --> 00:22:24.576
my heart

00:22:26.211 --> 00:22:27.412
my heart

00:22:27.813 --> 00:22:29.114
my heart

00:22:29.648 --> 00:22:30.982
my heart

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:41.159
What should I do? It's bad.

00:22:46.431 --> 00:22:47.466
Are you dead?

00:22:48.367 --> 00:22:50.836
Yes, son, what should I do this time?

00:22:57.542 --> 00:22:59.611
Don't worry.

00:22:59.811 --> 00:23:02.581
I will find a suitable person. Take responsibility instead...

00:23:02.647 --> 00:23:03.782
Jang Tae Sun

00:23:04.182 --> 00:23:05.183
yes

00:23:05.984 --> 00:23:07.185
Is it Jang Tae Sun?

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:14.559
(current)

00:23:15.827 --> 00:23:19.464
I told him to handle it quietly. But you're blind

00:23:20.232 --> 00:23:22.868
Because of jealousy, because of being betrayed by a woman.

00:23:23.268 --> 00:23:26.671
and make it a big case That people know all over the country.

00:23:28.407 --> 00:23:32.177
I really made a mistake. But I've dealt with it. Don't worry.

00:23:32.577 --> 00:23:34.146
Just label him and that's the end of it?

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:37.616
What if Jang Tae Sun said your name in front of the police?

00:23:38.784 --> 00:23:40.685
- What? - What did he go through?

00:23:41.086 --> 00:23:42.788
I think he will let go. Do you want me to blame you again?

00:23:43.288 --> 00:23:44.623
Even a fool

00:23:44.689 --> 00:23:46.858
Sit and think for just five minutes.

00:23:46.925 --> 00:23:48.393
I realized who was trying to slander me.

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:54.332
But it is a person who...

00:23:54.399 --> 00:23:56.535
No one will be indifferent.

00:23:56.968 --> 00:23:59.704
Even if it says my name No one believes it...

00:23:59.771 --> 00:24:01.173
And what about Park Jae Young?

00:24:03.008 --> 00:24:04.843
Don't you know who Park Jae Young is?

00:24:05.277 --> 00:24:07.946
Have you forgotten that she chased all our businesses?

00:24:08.213 --> 00:24:09.648
Let her smell it.

00:24:10.182 --> 00:24:13.418
That mother is the type that will do anything. To know the truth

00:24:13.752 --> 00:24:16.888
Plus, this time Oh Mi Suk also left a message. That you see us together

00:24:16.955 --> 00:24:19.324
That's enough evidence. Let her start investigating.

00:24:20.425 --> 00:24:23.395
Moreover, Her line was also killed.

00:24:23.528 --> 00:24:25.063
And then Jang Tae Sun again

00:24:25.464 --> 00:24:27.232
If it says Moon Il Seok is behind it

00:24:27.365 --> 00:24:29.201
What do you think Park Jae Young will do?

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:39.277
manage...

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.148
Close Jang Tae San's mouth tightly.

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:46.251
What is it?

00:24:46.418 --> 00:24:48.253
Even if there are a million doubtful points

00:24:49.087 --> 00:24:51.189
Without evidence, nothing can be done.

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:53.859
Luckily, Park Jae Young went to a seminar in America.

00:24:53.925 --> 00:24:55.794
So she hasn't talked to Oh Mi Suk yet.

00:24:58.563 --> 00:25:01.533
- Then... - If the president goes crazy about this case.

00:25:02.901 --> 00:25:05.770
We cannot continue this project.

00:25:22.687 --> 00:25:25.624
Once the fingerprint examination is completed We will know the truth.

00:25:26.758 --> 00:25:28.960
Wouldn't it be better to confess?

00:25:33.632 --> 00:25:35.834
Sai Sueb Im, what do you want to eat before you go?

00:25:36.468 --> 00:25:39.337
When we know we're lying Just keep your mouth shut, you bastard.

00:25:39.804 --> 00:25:40.972
What do you want to eat?

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.742
I made it so I couldn't eat it.

00:25:44.543 --> 00:25:46.645
Hey, take it away.

00:25:53.451 --> 00:25:55.220
Should I eat jajangmyeon or jjampong?

00:26:03.895 --> 00:26:05.030
- Oh - yes.

00:26:05.163 --> 00:26:06.231
sister-in-law

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.268
What are you doing?

00:26:12.203 --> 00:26:15.473
I saw it as a murder case. So I thought that I would definitely have to stay all night.

00:26:15.574 --> 00:26:16.942
- Let's eat together. - Thank you.

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:20.478
It smells amazing.

00:26:22.347 --> 00:26:24.616
Look at that smile, Detective Im.

00:26:24.683 --> 00:26:25.817
What is it?

00:26:28.019 --> 00:26:30.422
I've heard news about your daughter.

00:26:30.722 --> 00:26:31.756
Congratulations.

00:26:32.557 --> 00:26:35.126
- Thank you. - This bastard is genuine garbage.

00:26:35.293 --> 00:26:37.629
Both gambling and nightlife Sometimes it's the host.

00:26:37.696 --> 00:26:39.364
Not long ago, he also went after Oh Mi Suk...

00:26:39.564 --> 00:26:40.665
sister-in-law

00:26:40.832 --> 00:26:42.167
We haven't seen each other for a long time, Mr. Ildo.

00:26:43.001 --> 00:26:44.936
I've always had luck with food.

00:26:45.003 --> 00:26:46.071
Let's see.

00:26:49.541 --> 00:26:50.642
What a son of a bitch.

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:53.545
See you again, Captain.

00:26:53.912 --> 00:26:55.547
I have to take care of Soo Jin as well.

00:26:56.481 --> 00:26:59.851
Once this case is over, I will give Detective Im a three-day break.

00:27:00.085 --> 00:27:01.119
sister-in-law

00:27:01.286 --> 00:27:02.487
You can go and rest for a moment.

00:27:03.588 --> 00:27:06.157
Jin Ildo, don't eat until I come back.

00:27:07.592 --> 00:27:08.627
Let's go.

00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:13.198
Thank you for the food.

00:27:19.838 --> 00:27:21.539
If Moon Il Suk was behind

00:27:22.574 --> 00:27:24.643
That means he wants me to take responsibility for the murder.

00:27:24.809 --> 00:27:26.678
Put him in jail again.

00:27:27.779 --> 00:27:30.181
But this time put the blame Without even telling each other

00:27:31.449 --> 00:27:33.018
Bastard

00:27:34.619 --> 00:27:37.822
If it weren't for Mr. Jang Taesan Sujin will probably die.

00:27:37.956 --> 00:27:41.526
Take care of yourself. Until the day of surgery

00:27:43.028 --> 00:27:45.964
What will the surgery be like like this?

00:27:48.933 --> 00:27:51.336
What should I do?

00:27:54.039 --> 00:27:56.641
No. Think about it.

00:27:57.375 --> 00:27:59.377
I have a brain like everyone else.

00:28:00.078 --> 00:28:01.246
Think about it.

00:28:02.847 --> 00:28:04.482
Do you have to work late into the morning?

00:28:04.716 --> 00:28:07.619
Sigh, this person is very stubborn.

00:28:08.453 --> 00:28:11.623
He wouldn't speak at all. So tonight I'm going to let you sleep.

00:28:11.956 --> 00:28:15.627
I saw the news How could he kill someone like that?

00:28:16.561 --> 00:28:18.363
Our lives are worth dying.

00:28:19.864 --> 00:28:21.199
It is murder from jealousy.

00:28:21.399 --> 00:28:22.867
I have thought about it in advance.

00:28:23.068 --> 00:28:25.503
People like that don't care about other people's lives.

00:28:26.004 --> 00:28:28.106
I just want to live my life however I want.

00:28:28.173 --> 00:28:29.741
When angry, it creates problems.

00:28:30.809 --> 00:28:33.945
Listen to what Mr. Ildo has to say. It's like he's living a dissolute life.

00:28:35.013 --> 00:28:37.749
I've been to prison twice before. Last time I told you this.

00:28:37.949 --> 00:28:40.885
That some people are born with this kind of nature.

00:28:42.253 --> 00:28:44.255
Hurry and go in. The dinner will be over soon.

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:49.260
Sujin would be life. Is it really In Hye's?

00:28:49.661 --> 00:28:51.996
Definitely enough about child surgery. He even brought me something to eat.

00:28:54.199 --> 00:28:56.668
Senior, the fingerprint results are out.

00:29:11.983 --> 00:29:14.819
This is a report from the scene at Oh Mi Suk's house.

00:29:16.321 --> 00:29:18.223
The whole house has your fingerprints on it.

00:29:19.157 --> 00:29:22.494
Including knives, suitcases, drinking glasses, doorknobs.

00:29:23.795 --> 00:29:24.829
Not only that.

00:29:25.497 --> 00:29:27.699
His drug test still came back positive.

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:40.245
I've already confessed.

00:29:41.412 --> 00:29:42.614
no

00:29:43.915 --> 00:29:44.949
not me

00:29:45.016 --> 00:29:47.786
Said it wasn't. I was slandered

00:29:48.153 --> 00:29:49.521
It's not me.

00:29:51.055 --> 00:29:53.858
Sit down, don't waste your energy.

00:29:54.459 --> 00:29:56.461
Sit down, sit down.

00:30:02.066 --> 00:30:03.868
Even if you insist that you didn't do it.

00:30:03.968 --> 00:30:05.470
But the fingerprints indicated the opposite.

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:08.506
Fingerprints found There's only Jang Tae Sun and Oh Mi Suk's.

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.175
There's no one else.

00:30:12.177 --> 00:30:16.047
That day, you did drugs and went to Oh Mi Suk's house.

00:30:16.748 --> 00:30:18.516
But she's getting ready to leave.

00:30:18.883 --> 00:30:20.685
Please drink a glass of water. try to persuade

00:30:20.752 --> 00:30:22.020
But the woman refused to listen.

00:30:23.021 --> 00:30:26.191
You were drunk and angry and couldn't stand it.

00:30:26.558 --> 00:30:28.126
“How dare you reject me?

00:30:28.827 --> 00:30:31.930
I might not get you But at least I can't stop him from going.”

00:30:33.231 --> 00:30:35.099
He took out a knife and started stabbing her.

00:30:35.166 --> 00:30:37.869
But when I used up all my strength Drugs cause drowsiness.

00:30:39.003 --> 00:30:42.707
So you lay beside her for a while. Then I opened my eyes.

00:30:42.907 --> 00:30:45.009
I'll see if she's really dead right then and there.

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:47.111
Suddenly, the police broke into the house.

00:30:51.182 --> 00:30:53.384
Please let me go.

00:30:53.451 --> 00:30:55.386
- Why did you come... - Could you please shut it up?

00:30:58.523 --> 00:31:01.593
And if you plan to use it The matter of being drunk is an excuse.

00:31:01.659 --> 00:31:04.262
Said he couldn't remember. That he himself killed the victim.

00:31:05.897 --> 00:31:07.232
Tell him not to be nonsense.

00:31:17.075 --> 00:31:19.010
Why aren't you sleeping yet? What are you drawing?

00:31:19.477 --> 00:31:21.679
The main character of my new novel.

00:31:22.213 --> 00:31:23.781
What story is this time?

00:31:25.483 --> 00:31:27.485
Why is this adult crying?

00:31:28.019 --> 00:31:29.654
He has his reasons.

00:31:30.989 --> 00:31:31.923
What is it?

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:35.093
Mom used to say that everyone has situations they can't explain.

00:31:36.194 --> 00:31:37.395
Mom told me herself.

00:31:38.296 --> 00:31:39.631
This kid is really talented.

00:31:39.831 --> 00:31:42.700
I never told my mother anyway. When will I finish writing?

00:31:45.803 --> 00:31:49.307
Where did Mom meet Dad for the first time?

00:31:51.976 --> 00:31:54.979
My father is a good person, right?

00:31:55.914 --> 00:31:58.816
Are you a good person like your uncle?

00:32:01.019 --> 00:32:03.688
Stop drawing and go to sleep. It's time to sleep.

00:32:12.964 --> 00:32:18.336
(The Eighth Busan Film Festival promotional show)

00:32:41.926 --> 00:32:43.094
Taesan

00:32:45.163 --> 00:32:47.031
Hey, where is it?

00:32:47.098 --> 00:32:49.200
He hasn't opened the store yet.

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:51.302
Follow me quickly, I'll take you to see something good.

00:32:51.602 --> 00:32:53.838
What will take you where?

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:01.846
- It's a real person. - It's not real. It's a fake. Try catching it.

00:33:04.282 --> 00:33:06.351
- Oops - I told you people.

00:33:06.718 --> 00:33:07.785
- What? - I'm sorry.

00:33:10.355 --> 00:33:11.356
Oh no!

00:33:12.123 --> 00:33:14.058
Look, it's a real person, right?

00:33:14.926 --> 00:33:17.595
But she hadn't moved for 47 minutes.

00:33:17.662 --> 00:33:19.097
His eyes didn't even move.

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:21.899
Why is it a person or a puppet?

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:24.002
Hurry, you have to save the money today.

00:33:24.869 --> 00:33:27.005
If it were a real person Do I have to pee sometimes?

00:33:27.772 --> 00:33:29.107
Let's wait and see a little more.

00:33:30.508 --> 00:33:31.843
Very cool figure

00:33:31.909 --> 00:33:33.177
I saw her finish peeing and then followed me.

00:33:34.178 --> 00:33:35.313
Let's go together.

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:37.215
How can I handle it alone?

00:33:38.316 --> 00:33:40.585
If we still haven't gotten one yet My son has definitely killed us.

00:33:56.067 --> 00:33:58.736
Do you want to know? whether it is a person or a puppet

00:33:59.103 --> 00:34:02.306
Yes, wait a little longer until she goes down to pee.

00:34:11.182 --> 00:34:13.451
- What? - What did he do?

00:34:13.851 --> 00:34:15.620
- What's wrong with him? - What happened?

00:34:18.156 --> 00:34:20.024
- Oh my gosh. - What are you doing to him?

00:34:21.292 --> 00:34:22.627
I'm dead.

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.429
- What happened? - What did he do?

00:34:24.962 --> 00:34:26.297
Trust him.

00:34:36.808 --> 00:34:38.743
- He's dead. - He's probably crazy.

00:34:39.744 --> 00:34:41.479
- Crazy - What's wrong with him?

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:54.959
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.028
Haven't come down yet.

00:34:58.529 --> 00:35:00.498
Let go, tell me to come down.

00:35:01.666 --> 00:35:02.800
What's wrong with you?

00:35:02.967 --> 00:35:04.302
Go away.

00:35:04.802 --> 00:35:06.437
Hey, come here.

00:35:10.741 --> 00:35:12.343
Real person or dummy?

00:35:14.645 --> 00:35:15.713
puppet

00:35:24.589 --> 00:35:25.923
excuse me

00:35:26.624 --> 00:35:27.658
You

00:35:29.193 --> 00:35:30.561
excuse me

00:35:32.897 --> 00:35:35.833
Probably knew you were coming. So he closed his mother's shop and ran away.

00:35:36.667 --> 00:35:37.902
Shut up.

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:40.872
Anyway, today I will catch it.

00:35:43.274 --> 00:35:45.143
Where has it gone?

00:36:03.294 --> 00:36:05.296
Is this person crazy? Who are you?

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:08.232
The mermaid your friend touched on her breasts?

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:15.573
Sir, when you came to arrest me, did you know that I wasn't a mannequin?

00:36:17.942 --> 00:36:21.312
I slapped you for what you did. This time answer me directly.

00:36:22.246 --> 00:36:25.383
When you came to arrest me, did you know that I was a person?

00:36:26.951 --> 00:36:29.253
If I knew, would I get caught?

00:36:31.289 --> 00:36:32.557
Shows that you don't know, right?

00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:34.425
show that it will say

00:36:34.692 --> 00:36:37.161
Do I really look like this?

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:41.933
Did you hear that? He said he didn't know.

00:36:42.233 --> 00:36:44.435
He doesn't know I'm a real person.

00:37:06.924 --> 00:37:09.727
Look at the tip of your finger. Very good.

00:38:10.354 --> 00:38:11.589
Hey, here's two million won.

00:38:11.922 --> 00:38:13.591
The remaining amount will be deducted from your salary.

00:38:14.558 --> 00:38:16.294
Did you sell yourself last night?

00:38:17.495 --> 00:38:18.829
Bastard

00:38:31.842 --> 00:38:33.778
Moon Il Seok had already planned it.

00:38:34.679 --> 00:38:36.814
It chose me as its scapegoat.

00:38:38.082 --> 00:38:39.917
Left my fingerprints, drugged me

00:38:41.919 --> 00:38:43.921
Tie me tight, there's no way out

00:38:44.355 --> 00:38:46.991
So what will the surgery be like?

00:38:53.431 --> 00:38:54.565
About surgery...

00:38:59.804 --> 00:39:02.440
Uncle is going to ask the prosecutor for help. I'll go out and get it.

00:39:02.773 --> 00:39:05.409
And will the prosecutor allow him to leave?

00:39:06.043 --> 00:39:07.211
Definitely

00:39:08.846 --> 00:39:12.116
He won't let me die. I had to let my uncle go for surgery.

00:39:13.451 --> 00:39:15.052
Uncle will tell you a story.

00:39:17.488 --> 00:39:19.123
The story of Moon Il Suk will also be told.

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:22.460
And will the prosecutor help him exonerate him?

00:39:24.328 --> 00:39:25.529
I think so.

00:39:27.331 --> 00:39:30.501
Until I found fingerprints everywhere.

00:39:32.136 --> 00:39:34.271
But you cannot rot and die in prison for the rest of your life.

00:39:42.947 --> 00:39:46.016
But anyway, don't worry.

00:39:47.284 --> 00:39:48.352
It's about surgery.

00:41:04.795 --> 00:41:05.830
Who are you?

00:41:05.896 --> 00:41:08.732
- Help. - Who are you?

00:41:09.033 --> 00:41:11.569
- Who are you? - Help me.

00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:13.204
help

00:41:13.471 --> 00:41:15.806
Who are you? Who are you?

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:17.341
Stop it.

00:41:17.408 --> 00:41:18.909
Please help.

00:41:18.976 --> 00:41:20.611
release me

00:41:20.678 --> 00:41:22.480
- You bastard - what happened?

00:41:22.613 --> 00:41:23.681
Bastard

00:41:25.182 --> 00:41:26.317
That bastard

00:41:27.151 --> 00:41:29.887
It's gone crazy.

00:41:31.489 --> 00:41:33.123
- What? - Oh.

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:35.292
I was lying down and suddenly felt someone grab me.

00:41:35.359 --> 00:41:36.627
I feel strange So I woke up.

00:41:36.694 --> 00:41:39.330
If you meet this bastard, he will take off my pants.

00:41:39.396 --> 00:41:41.599
Then it began to strangle itself.

00:41:41.665 --> 00:41:44.702
I was shocked and tried to stop him. Then he turned to press me.

00:41:44.869 --> 00:41:46.303
Bastard

00:41:47.104 --> 00:41:48.906
Let go, let go.

00:41:48.973 --> 00:41:51.208
Please help me.

00:41:51.575 --> 00:41:52.943
Please let me out.

00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:54.778
Please.

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.716
Not like that, you bastard.

00:41:58.782 --> 00:42:00.284
It's trying to kill me.

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:06.123
He used this rope to strangle me.

00:42:11.395 --> 00:42:12.429
Look.

00:42:12.663 --> 00:42:14.431
Hey, stop showing.

00:42:16.567 --> 00:42:17.968
Don't you believe me?

00:42:18.269 --> 00:42:19.637
Don't you believe a word I say?

00:42:19.703 --> 00:42:21.372
Jang Tae Sun, come out here.

00:42:23.941 --> 00:42:26.343
You bastard, who ordered you?

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:28.712
- Moon Il Seok ordered this, right? - Please help me.

00:42:28.879 --> 00:42:30.814
Let go.

00:42:31.081 --> 00:42:32.750
Hoy!

00:42:32.816 --> 00:42:35.452
release

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:08.452
(Congresswoman Jo Seo Hee)

00:43:15.459 --> 00:43:19.129
(Plan failed)

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:41.318
Whether to speak or not

00:43:42.586 --> 00:43:44.588
It's going to kill me anyway, right?

00:43:55.733 --> 00:43:57.935
Will you kill me no matter what?

00:44:00.304 --> 00:44:01.205
Why

00:44:02.573 --> 00:44:03.574
Why

00:44:08.145 --> 00:44:11.181
You're such a sweetheart, the photos came out so beautifully.

00:44:12.016 --> 00:44:13.050
So?

00:44:14.852 --> 00:44:16.654
So what should I do with the pictures?

00:44:17.087 --> 00:44:19.556
I have to give it back to Tae San.

00:44:20.491 --> 00:44:23.093
Next to the nail salon we have a photography shop.

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:24.762
I can go wash there.

00:44:25.095 --> 00:44:26.096
okay

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:27.498
There

00:44:32.469 --> 00:44:33.504
crazy people

00:44:35.406 --> 00:44:36.674
What should I do?

00:44:39.443 --> 00:44:42.613
Tomorrow I'll finish cleaning the pictures. I'll take it to Mr. Mansok's shop.

00:44:43.047 --> 00:44:45.249
Let's do it smoothly today.

00:44:45.616 --> 00:44:47.651
All right. How about it, Tae-san?

00:44:47.718 --> 00:44:49.119
- I came home late already. - That's true.

00:44:49.453 --> 00:44:50.988
I can go to bed quickly before you come back.

00:44:51.055 --> 00:44:52.856
- So smart. - Just a moment.

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:58.696
- Hello - Is this Mr. Go Man Seok's number?

00:44:58.896 --> 00:45:01.465
I'm calling from the homicide department. Yeongdeungpo Police Station

00:45:01.732 --> 00:45:02.833
Is it a police station?

00:45:04.334 --> 00:45:06.770
Bro, what happened?

00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:14.011
I don't have time to explain.

00:45:14.144 --> 00:45:16.046
Manseok, please ask for something.

00:45:16.213 --> 00:45:18.048
Are you asking for something?

00:45:18.115 --> 00:45:19.917
Oh Mi Suk, the woman I'm accused of killing.

00:45:23.353 --> 00:45:25.723
With Moon Il Seok, Chairman of Sungchil Capital

00:45:26.423 --> 00:45:28.926
Please go find out how these two people are related.

00:45:29.626 --> 00:45:32.262
- Oh Mi Suk and Moon Il Seok? - Yes.

00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:36.200
Oh Mi Suk used to work at a club called Wang Abang.

00:45:36.266 --> 00:45:39.837
It's Moon Il Seok's club. You pretended to be drinking there.

00:45:39.937 --> 00:45:41.171
Try asking the staff.

00:45:41.371 --> 00:45:44.208
Wang Abang? The liquor there is exorbitantly expensive.

00:45:45.542 --> 00:45:46.777
I'm probably crazy.

00:45:47.611 --> 00:45:49.713
All right, I'll go.

00:45:50.981 --> 00:45:52.015
I'll find it for you.

00:45:53.784 --> 00:45:56.754
It's annoying. It's a bit disturbing.

00:45:57.387 --> 00:45:58.589
Mr...

00:46:00.124 --> 00:46:01.525
You will be able to save two lives.

00:46:02.259 --> 00:46:03.961
We will start preparing for surgery tomorrow.

00:46:04.561 --> 00:46:07.931
Sujin will be sentimental. Because the steps are quite tiring.

00:46:08.365 --> 00:46:10.701
Your mother must stay by your side.

00:46:11.769 --> 00:46:13.904
Yes, I've prepared to take a leave of absence.

00:46:14.738 --> 00:46:16.006
What about Dr. Park?

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:18.609
Preparing for surgery What are you doing here?

00:46:19.076 --> 00:46:20.944
We will irradiate the entire body.

00:46:21.011 --> 00:46:24.181
will kill cancer cells Chasing her own bone marrow

00:46:24.782 --> 00:46:27.785
will make your body free Waiting to receive new bone marrow

00:46:28.819 --> 00:46:32.022
If you do that, won't your immunity be damaged as well?

00:46:32.089 --> 00:46:35.058
Because of this So she had to stay in the sterile room.

00:46:35.859 --> 00:46:37.728
And if we assume that

00:46:38.862 --> 00:46:41.064
What happened? What will happen with the donor?

00:46:41.431 --> 00:46:43.967
If he gets sick or a car accident

00:46:44.067 --> 00:46:46.970
If that's the case Soojin must.

00:46:48.338 --> 00:46:49.907
Stay in the sterile room all the time?

00:46:49.973 --> 00:46:51.708
It cannot be like that.

00:46:52.176 --> 00:46:54.011
Your own bone marrow will disappear completely.

00:46:55.846 --> 00:46:58.348
- And what will happen? - She will die immediately.

00:47:04.521 --> 00:47:07.024
What should you consider? Go talk to the donor.

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:10.594
We've made an appointment, right?

00:47:12.396 --> 00:47:14.898
Of course, don't worry about that.

00:47:15.632 --> 00:47:16.767
good

(Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency)

00:47:30.514 --> 00:47:33.350
MP Joe arrived here. Is there something wrong?

00:47:33.984 --> 00:47:36.386
I brought you an invitation to the auction.

00:47:36.887 --> 00:47:38.222
And there's something to talk about.

00:47:38.288 --> 00:47:39.289
Please sit first.

Thank you.

(I miss you. I miss you.)

00:47:59.843 --> 00:48:00.911
What is this?

00:48:01.245 --> 00:48:04.047
"I miss you. I miss you."

00:48:04.114 --> 00:48:05.315
Is that that?

00:48:05.616 --> 00:48:08.652
A few days ago a woman called. Please leave a message.

00:48:09.319 --> 00:48:10.954
Why do women come and tell me they miss me?

00:48:11.054 --> 00:48:12.289
So what's the problem?

00:48:13.957 --> 00:48:15.292
It's strange.

00:48:15.726 --> 00:48:16.927
What's strange?

00:48:16.994 --> 00:48:19.596
Lesbians usually say "I miss you, I love you" to each other.

00:48:19.897 --> 00:48:20.964
what?

00:48:23.367 --> 00:48:24.368
What are you talking about?

00:48:24.434 --> 00:48:25.669
I'm back.

00:48:25.736 --> 00:48:27.738
You see, is that a woman's voice?

00:48:28.272 --> 00:48:29.907
Definitely must be the man's side.

00:48:29.973 --> 00:48:31.008
Wait a minute.

00:48:33.110 --> 00:48:34.444
But he still likes her.

00:48:35.212 --> 00:48:37.114
What happened while I was away?

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:38.515
- Hello. - Hello.

00:48:42.452 --> 00:48:45.889
Prosecutors wait for email From someone who misses you?

00:48:47.858 --> 00:48:50.594
outside the office And I can't check my work email.

00:48:51.028 --> 00:48:52.930
I haven't checked my boyfriend's emails.

00:48:58.602 --> 00:49:00.404
Oppa, I finally did it.

Today, MP Joe and President Moon Please come to my house.

00:49:04.207 --> 00:49:05.509
Yes, I really thought about it.

00:49:05.575 --> 00:49:07.611
I set up the camera like you told me to.

00:49:07.678 --> 00:49:09.479
I don't know if I can record it.

00:49:09.546 --> 00:49:10.914
I got the email and please contact me.

00:49:10.981 --> 00:49:12.149
cool

00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:14.418
Prosecutor, is there anything good?

00:49:14.484 --> 00:49:17.321
Yes, very exciting things have happened.

00:49:18.188 --> 00:49:20.390
Told you I'd catch you.

00:49:20.624 --> 00:49:22.693
(write an email)

00:49:22.859 --> 00:49:24.127
Here's the prosecutor.

00:49:24.561 --> 00:49:26.129
It's a little strange.

00:49:26.863 --> 00:49:29.099
But it seems to be an important message.

00:49:29.333 --> 00:49:31.068
Yes, who left it?

00:49:31.134 --> 00:49:32.269
(To: Kim Tae Hee)

00:49:32.602 --> 00:49:35.005
From Mr. Kim Tae Hee

00:49:39.409 --> 00:49:40.944
Is it Kim Tae Hee?

00:49:41.011 --> 00:49:43.680
What? You're going to go even though you haven't reported yet. Is it about the seminar?

00:49:44.081 --> 00:49:47.951
I'll tell you the details. When I come back tonight.

00:49:48.719 --> 00:49:51.488
Park Jae Young, did you create a story?

00:49:52.856 --> 00:49:55.492
Right now I'm not sure.

00:49:55.559 --> 00:49:57.995
What is that look?

00:49:59.096 --> 00:50:00.764
I'll report when I get back.

00:50:01.832 --> 00:50:02.899
excuse me

00:50:06.536 --> 00:50:07.738
What's wrong with you?

00:50:08.338 --> 00:50:10.140
Did you eat something wrong in Chicago?

00:50:30.727 --> 00:50:31.962
Are you really not going to say it?

00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:36.633
I think that if I exercise my right not to speak So the mistake will go away?

00:50:37.334 --> 00:50:39.436
Continue to keep your mouth shut.

00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:42.906
The prosecutor took the case anyway. Because the evidence is clear.

00:50:42.973 --> 00:50:44.474
At that time, I shouldn't have killed her.

00:50:54.885 --> 00:50:56.186
Then why did you strangle yourself?

00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:07.297
Low class trash

00:51:14.071 --> 00:51:15.806
Did he really strangle himself?

00:51:16.273 --> 00:51:19.810
You probably thought it would be better to strangle yourself.

00:51:19.876 --> 00:51:22.112
It's probably better than going to jail. The evidence is this clear.

00:51:22.446 --> 00:51:24.381
Who would strangle himself to death?

00:51:24.815 --> 00:51:26.917
Detective Jin, can he hold his breath until he dies?

00:51:27.017 --> 00:51:30.620
Just claiming to have mental problems. The penalty period is less than before.

00:51:31.455 --> 00:51:33.156
Why can't I think of it?

00:51:33.457 --> 00:51:34.791
Senior Im is amazing as always.

00:51:35.392 --> 00:51:37.994
And what if that person actually tried to kill him?

00:51:38.061 --> 00:51:39.729
Those two people had nothing to do with each other.

00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:41.565
Jang Tae Sun is a hobo here.

00:51:41.631 --> 00:51:42.899
The other one is in Gangnam.

00:51:43.166 --> 00:51:44.868
He came to meet friends here. Then there's a problem.

00:51:44.935 --> 00:51:46.736
So why did he come to kill Jang Tae Sun?

00:51:46.803 --> 00:51:48.538
Killing him won't get anything.

00:51:49.673 --> 00:51:51.775
The captain has been at the meeting for a long time.

00:51:55.345 --> 00:51:57.981
Detective Im hurriedly wrote a report on Jang Tae Sun.

00:51:58.048 --> 00:51:59.249
Send it to the prosecutor's office.

00:51:59.316 --> 00:52:01.251
- What? - It's a ruthless murderer.

00:52:01.751 --> 00:52:04.621
We've got the fingerprints. But he still wouldn't speak.

00:52:04.688 --> 00:52:06.256
Keeping yourself to yourself won't do anything.

00:52:07.491 --> 00:52:09.493
But we have to force him to confess.

00:52:10.727 --> 00:52:11.895
Why did you do it?

00:52:12.195 --> 00:52:13.964
If I don't confess, will I survive?

00:52:17.501 --> 00:52:20.504
I had to make him confess. Before sending

00:52:23.073 --> 00:52:26.143
This is your father's order. Commissioner of the Royal Thai Police

00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:28.512
People are not satisfied with this case.

00:52:28.712 --> 00:52:32.415
You want people to see him go to court and go to jail quickly.

00:52:34.618 --> 00:52:36.019
It's Kim Tae Hee.

00:52:36.153 --> 00:52:37.687
Please check again.

00:52:41.291 --> 00:52:43.593
There is no guest named Kim Tae Hee staying here.

00:52:46.296 --> 00:52:48.398
If so, what about Oh Mi Suk?

00:52:51.568 --> 00:52:53.637
There is no guest named Oh Mi Suk.

00:52:57.007 --> 00:52:58.074
I understand.

00:53:00.644 --> 00:53:03.246
What happened? Why aren't you here?

00:53:05.582 --> 00:53:07.517
Who is your favorite female celebrity?

00:53:09.886 --> 00:53:10.854
It's Kim Tae Hee.

00:53:10.954 --> 00:53:12.789
I want to be born in the next life.

00:53:13.123 --> 00:53:16.493
Has parents, brains, and looks exactly like Kim Tae Hee.

00:53:16.993 --> 00:53:20.697
Yes, if you feel yourself in danger, what should you do?

00:53:20.764 --> 00:53:22.165
Go to Sera Hotel, use the name Kim Tae Hee.

00:53:22.232 --> 00:53:23.633
What's the secret code if you want to retreat?

00:53:23.967 --> 00:53:25.402
"I miss you."

00:53:28.738 --> 00:53:32.108
Jo Seo Hee and Moon Il Seok Both are as vicious as snakes.

00:53:32.642 --> 00:53:35.045
Moon Il Suk is a python. Jo Seo Hee is a poisonous snake.

00:53:35.245 --> 00:53:37.747
She could be strangled or snatched to death.

00:53:38.215 --> 00:53:41.885
Therefore, you must be very careful many times over.

00:53:42.219 --> 00:53:43.253
Do you understand?

00:53:43.386 --> 00:53:47.524
But I think Moon Il Seok Will you really like me?

00:53:51.294 --> 00:53:53.930
Even though I already have a wife But he still has new kids every year.

00:53:55.065 --> 00:53:57.400
Her style is perfect. He likes bright girls.

00:53:59.302 --> 00:54:01.571
Why do you like stupid women like me?

00:54:06.543 --> 00:54:09.846
Don't you call your mobile phone? Send an email to my personal email.

00:54:10.614 --> 00:54:12.515
I've been hacked by Jo Seo Hee before.

00:54:12.916 --> 00:54:14.584
Must be sent to work email only.

00:54:14.651 --> 00:54:17.654
Yes, I definitely won't do it.

00:54:28.999 --> 00:54:31.835
You went out to investigate without telling me?

00:54:31.901 --> 00:54:34.738
I'll explain it to you later. Can you go to Oh Mi Suk's house first?

00:54:34.804 --> 00:54:36.139
She's not hiding out.

00:54:36.406 --> 00:54:38.241
If you're home Please take her out.

00:54:38.308 --> 00:54:39.542
Now I'm going to your house.

00:54:39.643 --> 00:54:41.311
I'll go out and send you the address.

00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:01.498
What happened?

00:55:01.564 --> 00:55:03.767
Oh Mi Suk was killed.

00:55:06.002 --> 00:55:08.338
What is it?

00:55:09.339 --> 00:55:12.108
Oh Mi Suk was killed.

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:25.655
I intended to keep it closed.

00:55:25.855 --> 00:55:27.757
Every time I stop by?

00:55:28.525 --> 00:55:30.226
- Yes - What is it?

00:55:30.927 --> 00:55:32.362
Is it something I can't see?

00:55:33.663 --> 00:55:35.031
Cause I'm alive

00:55:35.999 --> 00:55:37.667
The reason I became a prosecutor

00:55:38.702 --> 00:55:40.804
People I must catch before I die.

00:55:42.005 --> 00:55:44.474
Who is your enemy?

00:55:44.574 --> 00:55:45.809
Let me see your face.

00:55:47.177 --> 00:55:50.013
If you see this, your life will be at risk too.

00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:51.181
I agree.

00:55:56.353 --> 00:55:57.654
Stop lying to me.

00:55:58.121 --> 00:56:00.190
Will risk my own life It's for other people.

00:56:00.757 --> 00:56:03.193
Who does that?

00:56:09.299 --> 00:56:12.102
If you see these faces And she'll be dangerous.

00:56:14.437 --> 00:56:16.005
I'm not lying.

00:56:18.608 --> 00:56:21.010
I was a drug addict and almost died.

00:56:21.444 --> 00:56:22.979
But you saved my life.

00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:25.849
If it weren't for you, I'd probably be dead.

00:56:26.616 --> 00:56:28.585
So I'm willing to risk my life for you.

00:56:29.519 --> 00:56:31.121
You really are a stupid girl.

00:56:31.621 --> 00:56:33.523
Let me see. Tell me what to do.

00:56:33.757 --> 00:56:35.024
I'm willing to do anything.

00:56:36.893 --> 00:56:39.028
As a person, you must know how to be grateful.

00:56:41.097 --> 00:56:42.499
Hey, you don't have to bother me.

00:56:43.133 --> 00:56:44.801
So just ask and see.

00:56:45.769 --> 00:56:47.570
So you don't trust me?

00:56:48.104 --> 00:56:50.473
Hey Oh Mi Suk!

00:57:33.917 --> 00:57:35.051
mother daughter

00:57:35.485 --> 00:57:37.921
Another 14 days, let's be patient.

00:57:40.657 --> 00:57:43.960
Mother's Sujin must have endured well.

00:57:45.762 --> 00:57:47.096
But mom?

00:57:47.897 --> 00:57:50.834
Who was the person who gave me the bone marrow?

00:57:52.335 --> 00:57:54.404
Mom told me it had to be a secret.

00:57:55.271 --> 00:57:57.040
Just like Santa Claus.

00:57:58.007 --> 00:57:59.209
Santa Claus?

00:57:59.943 --> 00:58:01.077
yeah

00:58:01.177 --> 00:58:03.680
“Sujin is a good girl.

00:58:03.746 --> 00:58:05.548
Stay for a long time."

00:58:06.149 --> 00:58:08.485
"Stay with mom for a long time."

00:58:09.619 --> 00:58:11.120
It's such a big gift.

00:58:11.454 --> 00:58:13.056
Just like summer Santa Claus.

00:58:14.057 --> 00:58:16.125
I really want to know who the donor is.

00:58:38.414 --> 00:58:39.983
Oh no!

00:59:04.541 --> 00:59:05.708
(policeman)

00:59:39.943 --> 00:59:42.011
- It's bad. - Be careful.

00:59:42.278 --> 00:59:44.247
- That's bad - I'm dead.

00:59:44.581 --> 00:59:46.249
- Wait. - Back off.

00:59:46.482 --> 00:59:47.550
Someone is injured.

00:59:47.850 --> 00:59:50.019
- Come help me here. - He's dead.

00:59:50.954 --> 00:59:52.822
- That's bad. - Come here quickly.

00:59:53.022 --> 00:59:55.024
- Hey - That's bad.

00:59:55.458 --> 00:59:57.160
- Help us. - Come quickly.

00:59:57.994 --> 01:00:00.063
- What happened? - I died.

01:00:00.463 --> 01:00:02.298
- Please help. - Please help.

01:00:02.365 --> 01:00:04.033
- Oh - I'm dead.

01:00:14.677 --> 01:00:16.879
- Help us - call 911.

01:00:18.181 --> 01:00:19.983
- This way. - What should I do?

01:00:22.318 --> 01:00:24.754
- Someone call 911 - He's dead.

01:00:48.311 --> 01:00:49.479
Dad?

01:00:50.413 --> 01:00:52.749
I'll have to bring it back later.

01:00:52.815 --> 01:00:53.883
Promise.

01:01:48.137 --> 01:01:49.205
Are you dead?

01:01:49.272 --> 01:01:51.040
- Is that okay? - Is that okay?

01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:52.475
Where are you going?

01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:54.877
- He's dead. - Is that okay?

01:01:55.812 --> 01:01:57.814
- Someone please help. - Oh my gosh.

01:01:58.081 --> 01:01:59.716
- What happened? - God.

01:02:10.026 --> 01:02:11.327
What will he do?

01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:14.731
Why haven't we come yet?

01:02:30.513 --> 01:02:31.948
Where are you going?

01:02:34.917 --> 01:02:37.487
I used to be a Dane

01:02:38.921 --> 01:02:42.291
born as a person Live life like a person

01:02:42.558 --> 01:02:47.063
(Seo Soo Jin's medical calendar)

01:02:56.205 --> 01:02:59.509
Since leaving In Hye I never thought that my heart

01:03:00.276 --> 01:03:02.078
I'll come back and dance again.

01:03:05.748 --> 01:03:07.784
Until I met that little boy.

01:03:07.917 --> 01:03:14.924
(Surgery day)

01:03:21.931 --> 01:03:25.234
I want to live as a human being for once.

01:03:26.869 --> 01:03:28.437
Just this time

01:04:05.174 --> 01:04:06.042
Captain

01:04:06.108 --> 01:04:08.311
The investigative team called. Said Jang Tae Sun escaped.

01:04:08.544 --> 01:04:11.214
The suspect who killed Oh Mi Suk Is that Jang Tae Sun?

01:04:11.414 --> 01:04:13.382
I will find Jang Tae Sun. Let's meet before Park Jae Young.

01:04:13.449 --> 01:04:14.951
This time I won't miss it at all.

01:04:15.017 --> 01:04:18.688
I've already taken care of Park Jae Young. It's enough to take care of Jang Tae-san.

01:04:18.921 --> 01:04:21.157
He entered the Mullaedong intersection. An hour and a half has already been set.

01:04:21.224 --> 01:04:22.758
But I still haven't found a motorcycle. Here's one.

01:04:22.825 --> 01:04:24.727
Search all over the country now.

01:04:25.061 --> 01:04:26.429
The prosecutor went to the pawn shop.

01:04:26.495 --> 01:04:28.464
Looking for a digital camera that was hidden and pawned.

01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:30.466
There is a pawn receipt, but why isn't the camera there?

01:04:31.067 --> 01:04:33.803
A murderer is someone who kills someone, right?

01:04:34.036 --> 01:04:36.672
Uncle was kind enough to give me bone marrow.

01:04:38.841 --> 01:04:40.243
Have you found Jang Tae San?

01:04:40.676 --> 01:04:41.577
Where?

01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:45.781
